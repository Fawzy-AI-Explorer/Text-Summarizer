According to the company, they had chosen the name Isis for their latest brand of underwear several months ago, before the terrorist organisation came to public prominence. The range of underwear costs between £14 for the Isis thong to £50 for the Isis Cami Suspender. Scroll down for video . Ann Summers has apologised for any offence caused by its new range of Isis branded lingerie . The firm said they had named the sexy range after the Egyptian goddess of fertility and not the terrorists . A spokesperson for Ann Summers said: 'We acknowledge the unfortunate timing of this product launch in our store windows, however we in no way support or condone any act of terrorism or violence. 'We apologise for any offence caused.' The range of eight garments are black-and-white in colour and offer a range of coverage and are on sale from the more than 100 stores across Britain and on the company's website.

According to Encyclopedia Britannia: 'Isis was a good queen who supported her husband and taught the women of Egypt how to weave, bake, and brew beer.' However, she also shares a name now with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), who have since shortened their name to the Islamic State, (IS).

Katy Winter . Down in the dumps about your love life? If you've tried speed dating, love websites, grindr, tinder and the rest, but still despair of finding the perfect partner, a new venture could leave you flushed with romance. Dating site DoingSomething.co.uk has launched a new singles event: Toilet Dating! A dating website hopes to flush awkward first dates down the toilet by combining alcohol and a guided tour of London loos . The tour involves visiting public toilets and drinking while learning about their history and mingling with other singles . The concept is essentially a pub crawl, which due to the ice-breaking effects of alcohol has always been a popular first date activity. However rather than quaint pubs or swanky bars, the tour stops off at public conveniences. The website has teamed up with London Loo Tours to host one-of-a-kind events with a twist. The new dating experience is currently being piloted in London throughout August, with plans to roll it out nationwide later this year, if all goes to plan. Single men and women are led on a bar crawl around London's Westminster with stops at toilets of historical note along the way. As well as loo puns galore, the evening contains tips and tricks for locating free public loos in London, the history of the lavatory from pre-Roman times to the present, and facts about the politics surrounding the public toilet. Toilet Dating encourages singletons to share their own dating horror stories – toilet-related or not –  to flush away memories of bad dates. Sometimes good old-fashioned candlelight and romance is just so boring... In an over-saturated dating scene, it may be that this rather bizarre concept catches on across the country . A spokesman for DoingSomething.co.uk, comments: 'Nothing would be more awkward than having a first date in a toilet… until now. ‘At worst, the daters will have to indulge in some crap chat - but the experience won't be one they'll forget in a hurry.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"New dating event involves touring public toilets on a pub crawl .\\nAs well as meeting singles you learn the history of the lavatories .\\nExperts share facts about the politics behind public conveniences .\\nCurrently being pioneered in London, hoping to expand nationwide .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Immigrants from the Middle East seeking asylum in the UK  will face tough new language tests after 100 per cent of applicants claiming to be Palestinians were found to be lying. Experts in Arabic dialects and accents will also check applicants from Syria and Kuwait. Mark Harper said 'linguistic analysis' will be used on those that are believed to be lying about their origins . The Government made the move after a pilot scheme revealed that on top of the bogus Palestineian applications, 80 per cent of asylum seekers who claimed to have fled the war in Syria had also lied about their country of origin, along with 79 per cent from Kuwait. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said that ‘linguistic analysis’ will be used on applicants if it is strongly suspected that claims about their origin are  false and they do not have any documents to prove where they have come from. Mr Harper said the language testing would be voluntary, but anyone who refused to take it would have their decision ‘taken  into account against them’. Immigrants are claiming to be from Palestine, pictured, who are in conflict with Israel . Arabic is the main language of the Middle East and North Africa. However, there are notable differences in dialect, accent and vocabulary in the Middle East. Now applicants claiming to be Palestinian, Kuwaiti or Syrian  will be assessed after speaking  to an Arabic expert in their native dialect.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Immigrants claiming to be from Palestine will have linguistic tests .\\n100 per cent of applicants claiming to be Palestinian were lying .\\nArabic is the main language in the Middle East and North Africa .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(EW.com) -- There will be less boobs at next year's Oscars. Seth MacFarlane, whose irreverent hosting performance at the 2013 Academy Awards was controversial but a ratings hit, announced today that he wouldn't be taking the stage again next year. \"Traumatized critics exhale: I'm unable to do the Oscars again. Tried to make it work schedule-wise, but I need sleep,\" he tweeted Monday afternoon. \"However, I highly recommend the job, as Zadan and Meron are two of the most talented producers in the business. My suggestion for host is Joaquin Phoenix.\" MacFarlane is currently directing and appearing in \"A Million Ways to Die in the West,\" a stud-studded Western headlined by Amanda Seyfried and Charlize Theron. MacFarlane's withdrawal will likely appease some members of the Hollywood community who didn't appreciate his humor â€” which drew criticism that his jokes ranged from juvenile to misogynistic. But despite the tsk-tsking by some, ratings for the show were up significantly, including an 11 percent jump in the demo. Joaquin Phoenix is likely not in the mix to succeed MacFarlane (unfortunately), but the Academy is now free to go in a different direction. Perhaps they could appease some of last year's critics with a female host... or two. See original story at EW.com.

Kerry traveled to Juba on Friday to push for face-to-face meetings between the feuding leaders. Thousands of people have died in South Sudan because of drought and political violence. About a week ago, rebels slaughtered at least 400 people in the town of Bentiu. Kerry, speaking at a news briefing in Juba, said he'd spoken with Kirr, who was willing to go to Ethiopia for the talks. Machar had indicated a willingness to meet through Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Kerry said. He said the talks might take place early next week. South Sudan celebrated its independence from Sudan three years ago after an internationally brokered referendum. Last year, Kiir accused Machar, his former vice president, of planning a coup. New violence broke out in the war-torn nation. \"I fear that South Sudan's leaders are locked in a purely personal power struggle, with little or no regard for the appalling suffering that it inflicts on their people,\" said Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Thousands have died in South Sudan because of drought and political violence .\\nKerry says feuding leaders might meet next week .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

At the time hopes for Skinny the 41-pound obese stray cat found roaming the streets of Texas last year didn't look so good. But in six months' time the orange tabby has shed a remarkable seven pounds while additionally taken into the permanent home and care of his veterinarian, Brittney Barton of Dallas. In a newly released photo of the tabby seen lounging around Dr. Barton’s home - as well as affectionately in her arms - she reports that Skinny is doing well while on a special diet to help lose weight and increase his metabolism. Check me out: Seen lounging in his new home in Dallas, Texas on Friday, Skinny the former 41-pound cat poses for pictures in his new 34-pound body . Dr Barton says she became attached to the cat - that weighed as much as an average 5-year-old child according to U.S. government growth charts - while treating him at an animal orphanage. Last month, after a campaign to find Skinny a new home, he became part of her family. Skinny now joins Dr Barton's husband, three children, a dog and another cat at her Dallas home. Barton says Skinny gets along great with the other animals, can jump up on a couch and runs - not waddles - to his food bag at feeding time. Before and after: Skinny is seen left while weighing in at 41-pounds while on Friday he was seen in the arms of his new owner Dr Brittney Barton while weighing seven pounds less . Too big: Skinny was photographed here after she was found wandering the streets of Dallas, morbidly obese . Kitty steps: Skinny, seen before his weight loss, was put on a strict diet allowing him to shed seven pounds without strenuous exercise . She says the house has long hallways that provide good exercise for Skinny. No doubt Skinny’s rapid and ongoing success is the perfect role model for other fat cats out there. Though Skinny weighed in an average of 25 pounds more than the average feline, he wasn’t the heaviest kitty on record.

Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani was originally sentenced to death by stoning, but it was put on hold earlier this month after an international outcry. In London, protesters held posters with Ashtiani's likeness while a speaker criticized Iran's treatment of her. Many demonstrating in Trafalgar Square held signs reading, \"No to Stoning. No to Executions.\" John Lennon's \"Imagine\" played in the background. In Stockholm, Sweden, protesters chanted for Ashtiani's release while calling stoning a medieval practice that must end. They also signed a large petition calling for her release. The case has drawn international attention. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and faces the possibility of execution. The London protesters said Iran has unfairly sentenced others to death, including 18 gay citizens. In Toronto, Canada, one woman showed a graphic display with red-colored stones to symbolize the instruments and results of stoning. Despite the sentencing delay, human rights activists wanted to remind the world of Ashtiani's plight, said Mina Ahadi, chairman of the International Committee Against Execution and Stoning, one of the group's leading Saturday's protests. \"The fact is, the execution can still happen,\" Ahadi said. \"And, often times in Iran, these types of executions will happen without any notice.\" More than 30 cities participated in \"International Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani Day\" at 2 p.m. local time. Cities holding rallies included Washington, New York, London, Venice, Paris, Berlin and Ottawa, organizers said. Organizers hoped the rallies would help free Ashtiani and intensify the international support she gained earlier when her case was widely publicized. \"International pressure is what causes change,\" Ahadi said. \"The authorities in Iran aren't immune to this pressure -- we want to release Ashtiani, and we think these rallies are a huge factor in doing so.\" Earlier this month, Ashtiani's lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN that she confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. She later recanted the confession and has denied wrongdoing, he said. Iranian state media reported this month that the nation's judiciary chief halted the execution of Ashtiani. \"Although the verdict still stands and is definite, the execution has been halted on humanitarian grounds from the order of the honorable judiciary chief, and will not be implemented at this time,\" Malek Ajdar Sharifi, a judiciary official in East Azerbaijan province, told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. Human rights activist Maryam Namazie said Saturday's protests are critical for freeing Ashtiani. \"Very often the regime has quietly and privately executed people even though it said it's not going to,\" said Namazie, spokeswoman of Iran Solidarity and One Law for All.

In a statement, Chile's Geological and Mining Service stressed that no mandatory evacuations have been ordered around the remote volcano, which lies about 280 kilometers southeast (175 miles) of Concepcion, though the closest roads to it are in Argentina. Even though the seismic activity suggests a minor eruption, the agency decided to raise the alert level because it could not rule out a major eruption. The service warned specifically about potentially dangerous mudslides within a 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) radius of the crater. Alto Biobio, a community about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Copahue, is under the heightened alert. The governor and emergency officials in Biobio province met Sunday afternoon to discuss possible scenarios, including establishing a plan in case a mass evacuation is deemed necessary. Seismic stations first detected increased activity Saturday, according to the Volcano Observatory of the Southern Andes, which is part of Chile's Geological and Mining Service. In addition, more gas than normal has been detected coming from the volcano. The black, ash-filled gas has soared as 1.5 kilometers (almost 1 mile) above Copahue and extended 13 kilometers (8 miles) out from it, toward the southeast. Known in South America as Volcan Copahue, this volcano formed about 500,000 years ago and contains a string of nine craters in this stretch of the Andes, according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program. Its summit is just less than 3000 meters, or 9,830 feet, above sea level. Mild to moderate eruptions have been recorded here since the 18th century, and some in the 20th century spewed volcanic rocks and chilled liquid sulfur fragments from its 300-meter wide crater lake, the Global Volcanism Program reports. After at least three eruptions during the 1990s, Copahue's last significant eruption occurred from July to October 2000. That incident caused damage, mudslides and spurred evacuations.

The Germany international was a target for Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford but has committed to Pep Guardiola's vision for the next five years. Philipp Lahm will also be staying put at the Allianz Arena after agreeing an extension to his deal until 2018 - one that is sure to see his career end in Munich. All smiles: Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm (right) have both signed new contracts at Bayern Munich . Boost: Muller and Lahm will prove key figures for Joachim Low's Germany at this month's World Cup in Brazil . Focused: Muller trains with central defender Mats Hummels ahead of Germany's opener with Portugal . Muller had been the subject of interest from across Europe this summer and looked like he could have been on his way out of the Bundesliga champions when he sought assurances over his role within Guardiola's setup. But the 25-year-old revealed that talks with senior figures at the club won him over. 'I am very happy to have extended my contract at Bayern until 2019,' Muller told the club's official website. 'There were some very good discussions with the club who made me realise that I am in the right place here. 'I have the feeling that I am an important part of the club's plans. Bayern Munich has been my club since 2000 and it will remain so in the coming years.'

Kevin Kilbane, a former Republic of Ireland international who played with Everton in the English Premier League, reported West Ham supporters to the English Football Association for derogatory chants against Tottenham's Harry Kane during Sunday's game. The former winger, who now works for the BBC, was not at the game but was shocked to hear \"mong\" chants had been sung at the game. Kilbane was told about the chants by Andy Merriman -- a Tottenham season-ticket holder whose daughter lives with Down's syndrome. Kilbane's daughter Elsie has the same condition and he is a patron of the Down's Syndrome Association. \"The club emailed every supporter who had bought a ticket to Sunday's game to remind them that they were acting as ambassadors for West Ham United\" a West Ham spokesman said Monday. \"If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way, the Club's simple, zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban from the Boleyn Ground. \"If anyone has any information on such behavior we would urge them to report it to the Club, Kick It Out or the police so it can be investigated thoroughly.\" Tottenham were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN. \"I am sure they understand they are causing offence,\" Kilbane told the Guardian. \"You cannot sweep it under the carpet and label it as ignorance. It is visible and clear and, like racist or homophobic chanting, it is intended to cause offence.\" The FA confirmed to CNN that Kilbane, among others, had reported the incident and has promised a thorough investigation into the allegations. \"I want to be able to take my kids to football matches and when Elsie gets older she will understand about her condition and I would not want her to hear that kind of chanting,\" said Kilbane. \"If her sister Isla heard it, she would be devastated too, as my friend's sons were\" said Kilbane. In another incident on Sunday a group of men -- thought to be West Ham fans -- were filmed chanting anti-Semitic abuse on a train in North London. Both episodes follow the racism storm that engulfed Chelsea after its fans pushed a black man out of a Paris Metro carriage last week.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Footballer turned TV presenter Kevin Kilbane reported West Ham fans' disablist chants to the FA .\\nThe chant allegedly focused on Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane and mocked people with disabilities .\\nKilbane, who has a daughter with Down's syndrome, said his children would be devastated if they heard it .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Liam Neeson stars in 20th Century Fox's \"Taken,\" which debuted at No. 1 this weekend. That's a particularly impressive feat for a male-baiting film whose key audience has had plenty of distractions during this national football holiday frame. To be sure, the movie drew an A- CinemaScore review from a crowd that was nearly three-fifths men and 70 percent over the age of 25 -- an almost exact mirror of the big game's core demographic. For Neeson, who hasn't starred in a major Hollywood release since 2005's \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\" (to which he lent his voice), this is a nice turn of events, indeed: The $24.6 million premiere is the fifth best of his career, and, really, the top debut ever for a flick featuring him as a solo lead star. Certainly, \"Taken's\" weekend sum could decrease slightly after the Super Bowl is played tonight and the actual final Friday-to-Sunday box office figures are calculated, but the film has no chance of falling out of first place. That's because its next closest competitor was two-time champ \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop,\" which brought in $14 million and fell to No. 2. With $83.4 million in the bank to date, the Kevin James comedy is basically assured of becoming the first 2009 release to gross $100 million. \"The Uninvited\" (No. 3) was next, with a decent $10.5 million -- exactly the kind of first-weekend number that all Asian horror remakes seem to get these days. \"Hotel for Dogs\" (No. 4 with $8.7 million) and \"Gran Torino\" (No. 5 with $8.6 million) rounded out the top five. (At $110.5 million and counting, \"Gran Torino\" is now the top-grossing movie of Clint Eastwood's career.) And the other big new release, the Renee Zellweger comedy \"New in Town\" -- the kind of female-friendly counterprogramming that studio bigwigs typically expect to do well on weekends like this -- got little love at No. 8, earning just $6.8 million. Among Best Picture nominees, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" once again fared best, banking $7.7 million at No. 6, while all the others fell outside of the top 10 (i.e. they all banked less than about $3.7 million a piece). That result is a tad disappointing for \"The Reader\" and \"Milk,\" as both movies expanded somewhat wide this weekend (they grossed $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively). Overall, the cumulative box office was essentially flat with the same frame a year ago, when the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus concert film came out of nowhere to be the big winner. Just like the Arizona Cardinals will do tonight. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . Copyright 2009 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

He also said that he had never before received any threats against his life. The attacker detonated his car in front of the main gate at Khosa's house, said Hassan Iqbal, a senior government official. About 20 shops in the market were reduced to rubble.

Kate Lyons . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 27 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:56 EST, 27 January 2014 . A New Zealand doctor has described the moment he fought off a shark with a knife which attacked him while he was spearfishing. James Grant, 24, initially thought that a friend was tugging him on the leg as he swam in murky water near Colac Bay on the South Island. But he quickly realised it was a shark and began stabbing it with knife he had in his hand. James Grant fought off a shark while spearfishing, then stitched himself up and went to the pub . 'I looked behind to see who it was and got a bit of a shock,' Dr Grant told Radio New Zealand. 'I am not sure how effective (the knife) was. I guess it let go so something must have happened, put a few nicks in it.' The creature retreated and he was able to swim to rocks. It was not until he removed his wetsuit that he released he had been bitten. Dr Grant then calmly stitched up his wounds, which were up to 5cm long, using a first aid kit he kept in his vehicle for pig hunts. He had signalled to his friends to indicate that he had been injured but they thought he was joking and kept fishing. 'I thought surely he hasn't been bitten, there's no way he has been bitten, he's got to be taking the p**s,' his friend Mackley Lindsay told stuff.co.nz. When his friends got out of the water and saw his injuries they took Dr Grant to Colac Bay Tavern for a drink. The pub proprietors also gave him a bandage because he was dripping blood on the floor. Dr Grant was stitched up properly on Monday by his colleagues at Southland Hospital when he went back to work. Sevengill shark: The creature Dr Grant believed attacked him . Scene of the shark attack: Colac Bay on the South Island of New Zealand . Although he did not see the creature, he believes it was a sevengill shark and about 20cm wide across the jaw. Sevengills grow up to three metres long, and New Zealand is one of a few countries where they attack humans. Attacks by the sevengill are relatively common around the Southland and Otago coast.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"James Grant, 24, was attacked while fishing off New Zealand coast .\\nDid not realise he had been bitten until he removed his wetsuit .\\nSewed himself up with the first aid kit he kept in his car .\\nThen went to the pub with friends... where he bled on the floor .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A tsunami watch issued for five nations after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean was canceled about two hours later.

John Atta Mills, left, of the opposition NDC has defeated Nana Akufo-Addo, right, of the ruling NPP in the runoff. The chairman of the Ghana Electoral Commission, Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, said Mills had garnered about 4,521,032 votes, or about 50.2 percent of the total votes cast. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, of the incumbent New Patriotic Party, won about 49.77 percent of the total valid votes cast, Afari-Gyan said, according to the commission's Web site. The two men led a field of eight candidates in the December 7 general election, but neither secured a majority of the votes. Akufo-Addo had held a slight lead in that vote. The runoff election was so close that it could not be decided until the last of the 230 constituencies, the Tain constituency, voted on Friday. \"On the basis of the official results given, the results of the run-off election in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region, which was held on the 2nd January 2009, it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the President-elect of Ghana,\" Afari-Gyan said, according to the government's Web site. Both parties had alleged irregularities in voting in the Ashanti region and Volta regions, but Afari-Gyan said the commission did not find evidence in \"purely electoral matters\" that invalidated the results. Mills, 64, will replace John Agyekum Kufuor as Ghana's president on January 7. Kufuor is stepping down after serving two four-year terms, the maximum allowed. Mills is a law professor who served as vice president from 1997 to 2000 under Jerry Rawlings. He lost to Kufuor in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Ghana, a country about the size of England, is the world's second-biggest cocoa and gold producer. In 2007, leaders announced the discovery of oil off its shore. The world recession, however, has hindered growth. Ghana has seen a decline in its exports and will not tap into its oil resources until 2010. Part of a former British colony, Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence in 1957. It endured a series of coups before military dictator Rawlings took power in 1981. A decade later, Rawlings led the country through the transition to a stable democracy with multi-party elections.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"NEW: Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills wins presidential election .\\nNana Akufo-Addo of the incumbent NPP has been ousted .\\nRunoff election was so close it could not be decided until a final vote on Friday .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nTiger Woods will miss next month’s US Open as he continues his rehabilitation from back surgery, the American announced on Wednesday. The 38-year-old world number three last week gave the strongest indication yet that he would not be able to compete at Pinehurst from June 12-15, admitting his recovery from his March 31 operation was 'slow and tedious' and saying he was still unable to hit full shots. Woods said on www.tigerwoods.com: 'Unfortunately, I won’t be there because I’m not yet physically able to play competitive golf. Concerns: Tiger Woods feared his golf career was over after suffering a back injury . 'I’d like to convey my regrets to the USGA leadership, the volunteers and the fans that I won’t be at Pinehurst.' Woods, who underwent microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in his back eight weeks ago, has not competed since the final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship on March 9. He continued to remain positive about his future, though, adding: 'The US Open is very important to me, and I know it’s going to be a great week. Despite missing the first two majors, and several other important tournaments, I remain very optimistic about this year and my future.' This marks the sixth major the player will have missed since winning his 14th in 2008 at the US Open. Knee surgery following that victory led to an eight-month lay-off and caused him to miss the Open and PGA championships. In 2011 he . sat out the US Open and Open Championship due to knee and Achilles . injuries, while this year’s back surgery meant he missed the Masters for . the first time in his career. Question time: Woods released a statement on his website confirming his withdrawal from the US Open . That cast further doubt on his ability to surpass Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18 major titles, but Woods was bullish about his prospects. Speaking on May 19, he said: 'The only doubts I had were prior to the surgery. I couldn’t function any more. 'I’ve had knee surgeries in the past and, yeah, I was hurting going into it, but I was functioning. Right before this surgery I couldn’t do much. Forget about playing golf at the highest level - I couldn’t get out of bed. 'I was certainly doubtful at that point. Am I going to be pain-free? Am I actually going to be able to do this again where I can get out of bed and play with my kids and play golf? 'But after I had the procedure it was immediate relief and just a matter of getting through that pain part.

A 10-year-old boy was tragically killed in a hit-and-run after the car he was traveling in was forced off the road due to icy conditions in Austin, Texas, on Saturday night. Yahir Vidal was a passenger along with other family members when the driver of the Ford Mustang lost control near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The car stopped in the outside lane of U.S. 183 and as everyone exited, a white Chevy pickup truck hit the boy and his grandfather. Icy conditions in Texas have caused a number of accidents in recent days and was a contributing factor in the tragic death of 10-year-old Yahir Vidal . The Chevy then hit another truck driving in the opposite lane and did not stop, reports Statesman.com. The crash was reported about 10:33 p.m. on Saturday. First responders took the grandfather to the hospital with injuries, but young Yahir was pronounced dead at the scene. The child's uncle was also injured, but the Texas Department of Public Safety DPS has not yet released a full list of injuries. DPS also said that a car carrying more members of Yahir’s family was following his car and stopped when they lost control.

Hollywood is bracing itself for one of its most disappointing months in recent memory after a series of big budget productions have bombed at the box office. This summer has seen fierce competition at cinemas with over 20 films boasting budgets of $100 million (£66million) or more fighting to fill the seats. Top of the flops appears to be Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' which despite starring roles for Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, only brought in $29 million on it's opening July 4 weekend. Scroll down for video . Bombs away: Disney's $225 million 'The Lone Ranger' starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer brought in a disappointing $29 million on its opening weekend . It followed a disastrous opening for Sony’s $150 million 'White House Down' which garnered a paltry $25 million on the weekend of June 28. And there are serious concerns over Guillermo del Toro's $180 million sci-fi monster romp 'Pacific Rim' which is expected to open at around $30 million this weekend. 'R.I.P.D.', the Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds thriler about a team of undead police officers is projected to pull in less than $15 million, despite a hefty $130 million production budget. White House Down had a disappointing opening weekend and R.I.P.D. is not projected to open with a boom . There are concerns for Guillermo del Toro's $180 million sci-fi monster romp 'Pacific Rim' which is expected to open at around $30 million . And even the normally reliable Dreamworks production house could be left with a stinker as 'Turbo', a $135 million family film about a snail with dreams of speed, is also expected to do badly when it opens on the same weekend. It's a far cry from July 2012 when the last in the Christopher Nolan Batman series 'Dark Knight Rises' puled in $168 million. The Lone Ranger($225m)   $29m . White House Down($150m) $25m . Pacific Rim ($180m)           $30m (Projected) R.I.P.D.($130m)                   $15m (projected) 'Turbo', ($135m)                  $30m (projected) But according to the report on thewrap.com there are some encouraging signs on the horizon. Sony’s $80 million 'Grown Ups 2 starring Adam Sandler is expected to bring in between $40 million and $45 million . And Fox's X-Men spin-off 'Wolverine', starring Hugh Jackman is projected to draw a healthy $70 million when it opens on July 26.

The picture places Mrs Obama's face in a 1800 portrait of a slave with an exposed breast, and Magazine de Fuera de Serie likely knew the image was going to stir up controversy. The editors may have had a different message in mind given the historical context of the particular painting, but that sentiment was overlooked by online viewers who found the composite offensive and racist. Controversial: A Spanish magazine digitally altered a French portrait of a slave to include the First Lady's face . The portrait in question was initially released 1800, when French artist Marie-Guillemine Benoist exhibited the painting, titled Portrait D'Une Négresse, at the Louvre's annual salon. It was viewed as a inspiring image because the country had abolished slavery six years prior, and the portrait was thought of as an uplifting symbol of both women's and black people's rights. In keeping with the true meaning, the accompanying article translates to 'Michelle Granddaughter of a Slave, Lady of America'. Both Mrs Obama's great-great grandfather and great-great-great grandmother were slaves. From the preview of the article appears to be glowing- touting the axiom that 'behind every great man is a great woman'- but the full piece has yet to be released online. That seems not to matter to bloggers who feel the divisiveness of the image skews meaning, whatever it may be. Out of context: The article reportedly praises Mrs Obama's popularity in the run up to the US election . The fact that one of the slave woman's breasts is exposed in the portrait does not help to tone down the composite when it is attached to Michelle Obama's face. 'As a non-Spanish speaker I first looked at the image and just thought OMG that's Michelle Obama's boobs,' writes Jessica Wakeman on The Frisky. According to Clutch Magazine, the image is just one in a series of edited photos that show famous people's faces on the heads of other nudes. Mrs Obama will reportedly be joined by her husband Barack Obama, former President Abraham Lincoln and Princess Diana whose images are inside the magazine. Artist Karine Percheron-Daniels defends the artistic choice, saying that it shows an 'alternative unexpected reality' by allowing the viewer to see 'famous individuals in a different way'.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Magazine digitally altered French portrait of a slave woman from 1800 so that the First Lady's face appears on the nude subject's body .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Ghana captain Stephen Appiah says the west African side will be ready for \"war\" when they face Australia at the World Cup in Rustenburg on Saturday. Germany's shock defeat by Serbia on Friday means that another win for the Black Stars in group D would put them firmly on course for a place in the last 16, following their 1-0 win over Serbia in their opening match. Australia were beaten 4-0 by Germany in their first game but Appiah and teammate John Mensah said they would not be taking the Socceroos lightly. \"Every country has their own style of play and the Australians are physically and mentally strong,\" Appiah told CNN. \"It's going to be a war, it's not going to be a football game. It's going to be really tough, but we're ready -- it's no problem.\" Defender Mensah said Australia were a better team than their heavy defeat by Germany suggested. \"Just because they lost to Germany, that doesn't mean they're not good,\" Mensah told CNN. \"We don't underrate this Australian team. We will have to fight hard to get the three points.\" Appiah said Ghana had benefited from the support of the South African fans and said there was \"unity\" between all the African sides at the first World Cup to be held on the continent. \"We are all excited to be in Africa to participate in this World Cup and we all hope to support African teams who are still playing,\" said Mensah. Ghana are without their best player and regular captain Michael Essien but Appiah said the Chelsea star was in touch with the squad every day. And he said the team could still do well, citing Ghana's run -- without Essien -- to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola. \"He is one of our key players.... But it doesn't mean that if one guy is not there the team is finished,\" Appiah said. Appiah admitted that the official Jabulani tournament ball was proving difficult to get used to but he said it would be good for players, with goalkeepers being caught out by its unpredictable movement. \"This football is a little bit strange and it's difficult when you get a long pass ... it's kind of swerving, so you don't know where the ball is going,\" he said. \"A lot of goalkeepers are complaining about this ball.\" Despite beating Serbia, Appiah said the Ghanaians would not be getting carried away. \"Let's enjoy this moment and we will see what happens in the future,\" he said. \"We proved to the world that we know how to play football.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Ghana captain Appiah says team expecting tough match against Australia .\\nGhana beat Serbia 1-0 in first game as they seek to win place in last 16 .\\nAppiah says there is \\\"unity\\\" between African sides at first African World Cup .\\nAppiah: \\\"Let's enjoy this moment and we will see what happens\\\"\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Talented artists were today putting the finishing touches to a series of music-themed sand sculptures ahead of a major exhibition that will last throughout the summer. The international Sand Sculpture Festival starts on Monday and has turned the Black Rock site in Brighton into a sand village of the world's biggest music stars. Around 4,000 tonnes of sand had to be shipped in to Brighton for the 20 artists to work with because the city's own beach is pebbly. The King lives on: Pedro Mira works on his lifelike Elvis sculpture . Age old rivalry: Anique Kuizenga reignites the Oasis v Blur debate with her nineties-themed sculpture . Painstaking: A detailed sculpture of Bob Marley including his trademark dreadlocks and facial hair . But undeterred, the sculptors have got to work on the theme of Sing-a-Song of Sculpture and The Beatles, Beethoven, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Presley and Adele are already visible. The work is a painstaking task to create the perfect sculpting block. Layer by layer, the sand is mixed with water and compacted into wooden boxes using heavy machinery. Classical icon: Beethoven looks vivid in the sand with a forbidding expression . Finishing touches: The X Factor panel get a their rough edges smoothed . Rebel: A mod on a motorbike rides into Brighton . Local legend: DJ Fatboy Slim is mixing records on the beach . Co-organiser and sculptor Nicola Wood said: 'A lot of people are convinced that we mix cement or glue into the sand. They are wrong. It really is just sand and water. The secret is in the preparation. It takes a great deal of strength and endurance to compact such volumes of sand.' Co-organiser Alec Messchaert added: 'We have 20 of the best sculptors in the world here in Brighton so we are confident that our debut exhibition here will be a hit.' The exhibition continues until September 30. Soulful: Sculptors managed to create a strong resemblance to power ballad singer Adele .

Opponents may say some of his policy ideas are on the thin side, but George Osborne is doing his utmost to make sure his hair is not. The Chancellor was yesterday seen sporting a new style, with his hair brushed forward to cover up signs of a receding hairline. The choppy, layered cut is used by hairdressers to make it seem as though their clients’ hair is thicker than it really is, in turn helping them look younger. On view: The Chancellor's receding hairline could previously be seen (left), but the younger style (right) gives an impression of more hair on top of his head . It seems to have worked for Mr Osborne. The new style appeared to have taken a few years off the 42-year-old, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair. Mr Osborne was speaking to Lloyds Banking staff in Birmingham after the sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The Chancellor has hailed the £61million profit on the sale of the shares as more evidence the economy was 'turning a corner'. Mr Osborne claimed the £3.2 billion sale of a 6 per cent slice of the bank to institutional investors represented a half-billion pound boost to the public accounts - because of the way it is valued on the Government's books. Snip and tuck: Mr Osborne was speaking to Lloyds Banking staff in Birmingham after the sale of taxpayer-owned shares . He indicated that the disposal of the rest of the Treasury's holding, now standing at 32.7 per cent, may be opened up to the public in a stock market float likely to revive memories of the major privatisations of the 1980s. It comes five years to the day after then-Lloyds TSB stepped in to swallow up troubled Halifax Bank of Scotland during the financial crisis in a disastrous move that saw it needing to be rescued itself in a £20 billion Government bail-out. The first tranche of the re-privatisation saw financial institutions mainly from the UK and United States snap up stock at a price of 75p per share, above the 73.6p average price that had been paid for it by the Treasury. Talk: The new style appeared to have taken a few years off Mr Osborne, 42, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair . In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne said: 'This is a good outcome for the taxpayer. 'It represents a major milestone on the road from rescue to recovery for the British economy, and in further normalising the banking sector. 'This is the first in a multi-staged sale programme. I will consider all options for later sales of our shareholding in Lloyds, including a retail offering to the general public.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Chancellor seen with new style to cover up signs of a receding hairline .\\nThe style is used by hairdressers to make it seem hair is thicker than it is .\\nHe was speaking to Lloyds banking staff after sale of taxpayer-owned shares .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The youngest survivor of a plane crash that killed former Sen.

Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the site of the plane crash. Autopsies on the five victims found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, Greg Wilkinson, an official at the medical examiner's office, said Friday. He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash. Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said. A funeral for Stevens, who served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years, will be held Wednesday at the Anchorage Baptist Temple in Anchorage.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Willy Phillips Jr. was among four survivors of the crash .\\nFormer Sen.

Critics who’ve watched the pilot episode have been highly critical of the tone of the show, accusing it of relying on ‘poop jokes and sexy Asian schoolgirl jokes’ for cheap laughs. The show stars Seth Green and Giovanni Ribisi as successful video game developers and roommates whose lives are unexpectedly changed when their politically incorrect fathers move in with them. Scroll down for video . Bad dads: Fox's new sitcom has been accusing of relying on 'poop jokes and sexy Asian schoolgirl jokes' The dads are played by Martin Mull and Peter Riegert. The series is executive produced by Seth MacFarlane, whose animated comedies, including ‘Family Guy,’ have been regularly accused of bad taste, yet are also extremely popular. Critics have wasted no time in lambasting the show. Jace Lacob of BuzzFeed tweeted: ‘The worst part of #Dads is that it is casually racist AND horrifically unfunny. Which is not a good combination, really.’ NPR's Linda Holmes explained that ‘it's mostly nasty about women of color.’ The show stars Seth Green, right, and Giovanni Ribisi, left, as successful video game developers and roommates whose lives unexpectedly change when their politically incorrect fathers move in . The show is filmed before a live studio audience but even that has been criticized. 'Having people braying at “ironic” racism makes it real racism,' wrote critic Todd VanDerWerff. The stars and producers of ‘Dads’ faced reporters Thursday and attempted to defend the show by claiming that it focused on human frailties for the sake of laughs and enlightenment. At the Television Critics Association meeting, they vowed to tweak the tone of the series as appropriate as the season unfolds. However a critical mauling doesn't mean a show it destined to fail, 'Two Broke Girls' and 'The Big Bang Theory' are shows critics love to hate, but the general public just seem to love.

As poor weather cast a shadow over festivities on the east coast, hundreds of punters penned contributions to the social media trend 'five words to ruin Australia Day'. Scroll down for video . Budgy smugglers: Prime Minister Tony Abbott only recently discussed his collection of 'budgy smugglers', suggesting they were not always welcome . 'The Vegemite has run out!': The company behind the salt Australian spread selected empty jars of the product as their #FiveWordsToRuinAustraliaDay . 'Oh, I forgot the prawns': One of the short sentences Twitter users nominated as potentially ruining Australia Day . Some expressed dread about some common Australian experiences - a thong blowing out, forgetting to wear sunscreen or turning up to find the bottle shop has closed. Several national staples - including condiments, salty toast spreads and alcohol - were nominated as essential for an above average Australia Day. Nine Network reporter Sean Power's January 26 nightmare was: 'We're all out of sauce.' A disastrous spillage was on the mind of Twitter user Akshay Chougaonkar. 'I spilled your beer, mate.' The concept of no 'shrimps on the barbie' disturbed mum @_Natalie_: 'Oh I forgot the prawns'. And on this day of BBQ activity nationwide, Kristeen Peake joked, 'Sorry, I'm a vegetarian,' were ruinous words.

Sunscreen: Going without this essential item in the harsh Australian sun was widely feared by several punters . A day without snags? The barbeque was voted one of the most important Australia symbols . Somewhat unsurprisingly, the top concern for Kraft, the brand behind the iconic salty spread Vegemite, was: 'The Vegemite has run out!' Others punters conjured up mental images worth forgetting. 'Tony Abbott's here, wearing Speedos', quipped one commentator.

Gabrielle Giffords plans to attend the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour next month -- a little more than three months after she was shot in the head outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket -- her spokesman said. Giffords' husband, Capt. Mark Kelly, will command the shuttle. After spending the days after the shooting at his wife's hospital bedside, he decided in February that would continue his assignment as the mission commander. At the time, Giffords' spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the Arizona Democrat \"fully understands\" that her husband is flying the shuttle and supports his decision. \"I have every intention for her to be at the launch,\" Kelly said then. On Thursday, Karamargin said that Giffords is well enough to make the trip from Texas to Cape Canaveral, Florida. When asked when she will begin heading east for Florida, he said, \"We're not even there yet in the planning process.\" According to NASA's website, the spacecraft is set to lift off at 7:48 p.m. on April 19 from Kennedy Space Center. It will be the final mission for the Endeavour, and the second-to-last one for the entire space shuttle fleet. Giffords has been at TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston -- not far from where Kelly does most of his training -- since January, when she was moved there from University Medical Center in Tucson. Doctors treating Giffords have scheduled a Friday-morning news conference to provide an update on her progress. \"Two months after her injury, the congresswoman continues to improve,\" the Houston hospital said late Wednesday night in a statement. Giffords was shot at a \"Congress on Your Corner\" event in the parking lot of Safeway grocery store in her hometown. Six people were killed in the incident. The congresswoman, who authorities say was the main target, was among 13 injured. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Arizona entered \"not guilty\" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old Arizona man who faces 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting. Judge Larry Burns also scheduled a May 25 competency hearing for Loughner, and attorneys on both sides will be allowed to hire their own experts to evaluate Loughner's competency to stand trial.

The 28-year-old, who won Olympic gold in the 100 meters in 2004 and two world titles the following year, made his comeback at an athletics meet in Eastern Europe. He was the fastest in the 100m heats with a time of 10.34 seconds, qualifying ahead of his compatriots J-Mee Samuels and Rubin Williams at the Kuldliiga meeting in Estonia. Gatlin, who tested positive for excessive levels of testosterone in April 2006, then triumphed in 10.24 in the final from Samuels (10.31) and Williams (10.54). He had told reporters ahead of the event that he hoped to break the 10-second mark, but was nowhere near threatening his personal best of 9.85. He will again run on Sunday at an event in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. Gatlin had equaled Asafa Powell's former world record of 9.77 in May 2006, but this was later expunged from the books. During his time away from the track, Gatlin spent time working with American NFL teams Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans and Houston Texans but did not manage to earn a playing contract.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Former Olympic and world champion sprinter Justin Gatlin wins on comeback in Estonia .\\nThe American wins his heat and the final of 100 meters at Kuldliiga meeting .\\nHe was banned in 2006 after testing positive for excessive levels of testosterone .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nRather than blighting rooftops as at present, future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a Ghostbuster-style team. Scientists from the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering invented a new way to spray solar cells onto flexible surfaces using miniscule light-sensitive materials known as colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). Illan Kramer at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering said: 'My dream is that one day you'll have two technicians with Ghostbusters backpacks come to your house and spray your roof.' Scroll down for video . Illan Kramer (pictured) from the University of Toronto's Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering is one of the driving forces behind the developement . Solar-sensitive CQDs printed onto a flexible film could be used to coat all kinds of objects from laptops to aircraft wings. The surface of a car roof would produce enough power for three 100-Watt light bulbs or 24 compact fluorescents. And the breakthrough could send prices of solar panels crashing. The system sprayLD is a play on the manufacturing process called ALD, short for atomic layer deposition, in which materials are laid down on a surface one atom-thickness at a time. Until now, it was only possible to incorporate light-sensitive CQDs onto surfaces through batch processing - an inefficient, slow and expensive assembly-line approach to chemical coating. SprayLD blasts a liquid containing CQDs directly onto flexible surfaces, such as film or plastic, like printing a newspaper by applying ink onto a roll of paper. Potential breakthrough: Rather than blighting rooftops as at present, future solar panels could be sprayed onto tiles by a Ghostbuster-style team . This roll-to-roll coating method makes incorporating solar cells into existing manufacturing processes much simpler. Two papers published in the journals Advanced Materials and Applied Physics Letters showed that the sprayLD method can be used on flexible materials without any major loss in solar-cell efficiency. And the system is easily built using a spray nozzle used in steel mills to cool steel with a fine mist of water and a few regular air brushes from an art store. He added: 'This is something you can build in a Junkyard Wars fashion, which is basically how we did it. We think of this as a no-compromise solution for shifting from batch processing to roll-to-roll.' Professor Ted Sargent said: 'As quantum dot solar technology advances rapidly in performance, it's important to determine how to scale them and make this new class of solar technologies manufacturable . 'We were thrilled when this attractively manufacturable spray-coating process also led to superior performance devices showing improved control and purity.' Thing of the past? Traditional solar panels may no longer be the best way to harness the sun's energy .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Scientists from University of Toronto hope to make breakthrough soon .\\nSolar-sensitive spray printed on flexible film could coat all kinds of objects .\\nSurface of car roof could produce enough power for three 100-Watt bulbs .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A massive landslide swallowed homes in eastern Uganda early Monday, killing at least 23 people, the Red Cross said.

A study found that mothers-to-be who snore at least three nights a week are also more likely to need a Caesarean section than those who sleep soundly. The researchers said treating mothers’ sleep problems could help babies and cut care costs. Mothers-to-be who snore are more likely to give birth to a small baby, a study has found . Previous research has already shown . that women who start to snore during pregnancy are at risk of developing . high blood pressure and the potentially dangerous pregnancy condition . pre-eclampsia. More than a third of the 1,673 pregnant women recruited for the new U.S. study reported habitual snoring. Scientists found that women who snored in their sleep three or more nights per week had a higher risk of poor delivery outcomes, including smaller babies and Caesarean births. Chronic snorers, who snored both before and during pregnancy, were two thirds more likely to have a baby whose weight was in the bottom 10 per cent. They were also more than twice as likely to need a Caesarean delivery. Dr Louise O’Brien, from the University of Michigan’s Sleep Disorders Centre, said: ‘There has been great interest in the implications of snoring during pregnancy and how it affects maternal health but there is little data on how it may impact the health of the baby. Snoring during pregnancy is also linked to higher rates of Caesarean delivery . ‘We’ve found that chronic snoring is associated with both smaller babies and C-sections, even after we accounted for other risk factors. ‘This suggests that we have a window of opportunity to screen pregnant women for breathing problems during sleep that may put them at risk of poor delivery outcomes.’ Snoring is a key sign of obstructive sleep apnoea, which results in the airway becoming partially blocked, said the researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Sleep. This can reduce blood oxygen levels during the night and is associated with serious health problems, including high blood pressure and heart attacks. Sleep apnoea can be treated with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which involves wearing a machine during sleep to keep the airways open.

Polls will reopen at 9 a.m. Tuesday for the last day of voting. Egyptians are choosing between two candidates: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahy. Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb declared Tuesday a public holiday \"in compliance to citizens' wishes,\" state TV reported. The decision is thought to be a move to increase turnout. Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty. The election was called because Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, was removed from power in July in a popular military coup. A man working for el-Sisi's campaign was fatally shot near Cairo on Monday, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said. Mohamed Fathy, 35, was getting out of a taxi in the village of Kerdassa on the western edge of Cairo when he was shot in the head by unknown gunmen, Mahmoud said. Fathy was active in the el-Sisi presidential campaign and was a member of the Tamarod political movement, according to a statement from Tamarod. Police are investigating, but Assistant Interior Minister for Information Abdel-Fattah Othman has said the slaying has nothing to do with the election process. Tamarod has blamed the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, which had held a small protest in Kerdassa earlier in the day. Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, criticized the election: \"What you have in Egypt now is not democracy but a militacracy. ... What we have now is Mubarak coming back. Sisi is Mubarak version 2014, and that is the tragedy.\" Mahmoud also said a bomb was detected and defused at the Ahmed Sayed I school polling station in Giza. Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported clashes in a polling station at Umraniya district but said they didn't disrupt the vote. Beni Suef Security Director Ibrahim Hadib said that seven members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested for trying to disrupt the electoral process in that town, MENA reported. A number of people hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of el-Sisi's campaign in the town of Hosh Issa. No material damage or casualties were reported, MENA said. The Sabahy campaign similarly reported disruptions. \"The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces,\" it said in a statement. \"The campaign hopes that these violations would not repeat tomorrow.\" Opinion: Egypt's youth needs more than tinkering at the edges .

RollingStone.com: Choose the cover of Rolling Stone, round two: Vote by April 14! The resulting collaborations will be visible all around the Coachella grounds -- right up to the main stage itself, which London's United Visual Artists are building into a three-dimensional lighting sculpture that will move and unfold over the course of the festival. During Animal Collective's Saturday night set, this will be supplemented by a \"psychedelic jumbletron,\" otherwise known as a live collage of footage from the performance (created with help from Animal Collective's avant-garde pals Black Dice). Elsewhere on the site, attendees can drop by \"Untitled (A physical manifestation of 'Ladies and Gentlemen we are Floating In Space')\" -- a cathedral-inspired structure filled with deconstructed portions of Spiritualized's 1997 signature song produced in collaboration with director Jonathan Glazer -- or visit the dance-oriented Sahara Tent for a dazzling light show designed by Brazilian artist Muti Randolph. RollingStone.com: Random notes . Details on two further surprises Creators Project has planned for the Coachella main stage remain strictly under wraps for now: Arcade Fire reunited with director Chris Milk, who helmed their interactive video \"The Wilderness Downtown\" last year, for a mysterious collaboration called \"Summer into Dust,\" and Interpol is planning a top-secret work titled \"Under Surveillance.\" Adds Deborah Conrad, Intel's vice president and chief marketing officer, \"There's an X factor when you have art and technology coming together.

The Gunners are committed to bolstering their defensive options in January as fears grow over the lack of quality cover in the heart of their back four. Gunners spies have been identifying targets for several months, with their findings due to be discussed in the coming days. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Premier League Preview: Swansea vs Arsenal . Chris Smalling is among the names to be discussed during a scouting meeting this week . Vlaar (right) is out of contract with Villa in the summer and has also attracted interest from Manchester United . Arsenal want a clear strategy in place in their attempts to land a new defender when the January window opens. Renewed moves for Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk, Aston Villa skipper Ron Vlaar and Manchester United central defender Chris Smalling will be weighed up. All three interested Arsene Wenger during the final days of the transfer window following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona. Vlaar, who is also on Manchester United’s radar, could be available in a cut-price deal with his current contract due to expire at the end of the season. Arsenal tested the water with a £7million swoop for Van Dijk on transfer deadline day, while Arsenal wanted to take Smalling as part of a United’s failed move for Vermaelen. Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker are the club’s only two senior central defenders following Vermaelen’s exit. But Koscielny’s achilles injury has seen left-back Nacho Monreal play as a makeshift central defender in recent weeks. Arsene Wenger has been forced to use Nacho Monreal at centre back in recent weeks . Laurent Koscielny will be out of the game against Hull this weekend with an achilles problem . Tuesday’s Champions League capitulation against Anderlecht underlined the club’s need to reinforce their defence in January, but Wenger, who has been criticised for his failure to replace Vermaelen, will look to solve the problem in the next transfer window. Arsenal will also be in the market for a defensive central midfielder in January. Paris St Germain teenager Adrien Rabiot is on the club’s hit list - but there is a belief among some at Arsenal that they need the finished article in that position. They are also keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho, but his £37million release clause is a stumbling block.

Mendocino County sheriff's detectives are treating the death of 25-year-old Kayla Grace Chesser, from Willits, as 'suspicious' although there is 'no obvious evidence'. They have spoken to a man they believe was with Kayla at the time of her death and who was involved in a collision several hours after she died. Kayla Grace Chesser, 25, was found dead at her California home hours after returning from a Halloween party . The man is believed to have intentionally crashed his vehicle and was airlifted to an out-of-county hospital where he is currently being treated for serious injuries,The Press Democrat reported. Captain Greg Van Patten said deputies responded to a call by friends of the woman at around 6am on Saturday morning. He declined to give details on the cause of the death, other than to say it was not obvious. An autopsy is due to be carried out later today followed by toxicology tests. Kayla had been to a Halloween party with friends in Willits that night before returning to the home. It is thought that the man involved in the road collision had been with her during the night. Dance instructor Kayla was described as 'very talented' and 'just a beam of light.

Nearly 91 percent of China's Internet users are surfing the Web with a broadband connection. The number of Web surfers in the country grew by nearly 42 percent to 298 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center's January report. And there's plenty of room for growth, as only about 1 in every 4 Chinese has Internet access. The rapid growth in China's Internet use can be tied to its swift economic gains and the government's push for the construction of telephone and broadband lines in the country's vast rural areas, the report says. The Chinese government wants phone and broadband access in each village by 2010. Nearly 91 percent of China's Internet users are surfing the Web with a broadband connection -- an increase of 100 million from 2007. Mobile phone Internet users totaled 118 million by the end of 2008. While China's Internet usage has been growing in leaps in bounds, the government limits the Web sites its citizens can visit.  Learn more about China's Internet censorship » . Earlier this month, China released a blacklist of 19 major online portals and Web sites, including Google and Baidu, that it claims provide and spread pornographic or obscene content. The move came as several Chinese government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Security, launched a month-long campaign to clean up the Web, according to the state-run Xinhua news service. China has come under criticism for restricting Web access to ordinary citizens as well as on local and foreign media covering last year's summer Olympics in Beijing. The U.S. State Department noted in a 2008 report that China had increased its efforts to \"control and censor the Internet, and the government had tightened restrictions on freedom of speech and the domestic press\" and bloggers. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria in September 2008, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said, \"the freedom of Internet in China is recognized by many, even from the West.\" \"Nonetheless, to uphold state security, China, like many countries in the world, has also imposed some proper restrictions.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones and friends,\" Hecla Mining Company said in a statement announcing that the body of Larry Marek had been recovered. Earlier Sunday, the company had said it believed that Marek, a Hecla employee for more than 12 years, was dead. Rescue workers had been digging through rocky earth more than 6,000 feet underground in an attempt to reach Marek, 53, following the April 15 collapse at the silver and mineral mine outside Mullan, Idaho. Marek was one of two men working in that part of the Lucky Friday mine when a 10-foot by 20-foot section of mostly rock fell on him, said Hecla's President and CEO Phil Baker. This all occurred roughly 6,150 feet below the Earth's surface. While the other man -- who has not been identified -- got out unharmed, there was no contact from Marek. Baker said earlier the cause of the collapse had not been determined, promising an investigation \"after the rescue efforts are complete.\" Numerous special bolts and chain-link fence are used to keep the ground above the affected mine in place. Marek was trapped in a part of the mine where ore is removed and far from either of two possible exits, neither of which was adversely affected by the collapse, according to Baker. Lucky Friday is a \"deep underground silver, lead and zinc mine,\" according to Hecla's website. It has been in operation since 1942. Hecla has 275 of its employees routinely working at the mine, in addition to about 100 contractors, according to a company statement. Its website describes the Coeur d'Alene-based company, founded in 1891, as the \"largest and lowest-cost silver producer\" in the United States.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Larry Marek, 53, was trapped when the roof of the mine collapsed .\\nMarek was a 12-year employee of Hecla Mining Company .\\nThe cause of the collapse has not been determined .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nIn a crisis, Peaches Geldof is nothing if not versatile. Having accidentally tipped her baby out of his buggy while chatting on the phone, the young mother expertly demonstrated how to scoop him back up…while carrying on the conversation. Miss Geldof, 23, was quick to point a finger of blame for the calamity at London’s potholed pavements. Multi-tasking: Peaches out with Astala, left, before the buggy tips and crashes after hitting a pothole, right . Over he goes: Little Astala lies half out of the pram, but Peaches still has her phone in hand . Writing about the incident on Twitter, she said four-month-old Astala wasn’t injured. She insisted he had been strapped in but it would appear he was saved mostly by the hood of his buggy. ‘It’s impossible to see these cracks when pushing a pram,’ she wrote. ‘The Mayor of London should do something about it it’s ridiculous!’ Miss Geldof married rock singer Thomas Cohen, 20, on Saturday. The pair bought a flat in East London, before Astala was born in April. They wed in the same church where the family said goodbye to her mother Paula Yates 12 years ago. Friends and family of the couple made their way to the picturesque St Mary Magdalene at St Lawrence Church in the village of Davington, near Faversham in Kent. It is the second wedding for Sir Bob Geldof's daughter who wed American singer Max Drummey in Las Vegas in 2008. Hands free: She continues to chat as she gathers him up and is still on the phone as she comforts him . Blame: The new mother took to Twitter to point the finger at the state of London's potholes . The couple split in February 2009 but were not divorced until April 2011. Many of those arriving at the wedding were seen sporting retro-inspired outfits and there were certainly a number of snappy styles on show. On Friday Peaches posted a snap of her left hand to her Twitter page and wrote: 'Very soon my engagement ring will have a wedding band under it! SO excited- my last few days of not being a wife!!!!' Peaches was known for being a party girl in her late teens and early twenties but has settled down in recent years. Earlier this week the DJ enjoyed her hen party at a sushi restaurant in London but the event was an extremely timid affair with Peaches back at home before 11pm. Peaches and Tom announced their engagement in December last year and shortly after they revealed that Peaches was expecting their first child. Peaches' mother Paula died from a heroin overdose in 2000 leaving her and her sisters Pixie, Fifi and Tiger Lily to be brought up by Geldof.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Little Astala was tipped out of his buggy after it hit a pothole .\\nMother Peaches manages to pick him up while still on the phone .\\nShe takes to Twitter to blame the 'ridiculous' state of London's roads .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A 12-year-old accused with stabbing to death his 8-year-old sister at their Northern California home pleaded not guilty on Wednesday during an appearance in a Calaveras County juvenile court, his attorney told CNN. The boy -- who has not been named because of his age -- is charged with second-degree murder in connection with the killing. \"I say he is innocent,\" the boy's attorney, Mark Reichel, said. \"We are going to come back on July 31 to set a date for a trial on that day and we are getting into the issue of whether a 12-year-old can ever be put on trial for murder.\" Leila Fowler and her brother were said to be alone on Saturday, April 27, in their family's Valley Springs home when she was found dead. The 12-year-old told police that he'd seen an intruder leaving the home, then found his sister suffering from stab wounds. Sources: Suspect in sister's death had knife at school . The 8-year-old died minutes after arriving at a hospital, authorities said. After the incident, police offered a sketchy description of the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. They also interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community located about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. Authorities also combed the Fowler's home and neighborhood looking for evidence. Then on May 11, authorities arrested the boy. The boy's family, according to the attorney, is supporting him. He is \"doing OK under tough circumstances,\" Reichel said. Two adopted Utah brothers, 4 and 10, found dead; oldest brother arrested . CNN's Chelsea J.

Nearly half the locals admitted they could not be bothered to go for a walk, while only one in 20 gets on a bike in any given month. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said they were ‘caught in a lazy rut’, but blamed Sandwell for not being attractive enough to tempt residents out of doors. He added: ‘It’s a woeful situation where so many appear to have completely forsaken doing anything. But it’s little wonder. People who live on the Isle of Scilly, near Cornwall, have been found to be the most active . ‘A fat man might well ask his doctor why he should go out and exercise when all he can see is dreary buildings and all he can smell is the fumes from passing cars. What’s in it for him? ‘Councils must make sure there are areas in every locality which make it interesting to walk and cycle. I was in Sandwell recently and it has nothing. ‘We need places where people, particularly children, feel pleasure getting there and being there; parks and open spaces instead of ugly buildings and graffiti.’ The survey of 166,000 people in 326 council areas discovered that residents in Sandwell walked and cycled less than anyone else. The survey was tracking the lack of fitness in the UK when they connected it to obesity in Sandwell (stock image) Over the space of a month, only 58 per cent said they took a stroll of at least 30 minutes, while a paltry 5 per cent claimed to have  ridden a bike, three times below the national average. At the top of the scale, Scilly islanders led both tables with figures of 86 per cent for walking and 59 per cent for cycling. Sandwell – which includes West Bromwich, Smethwick, Oldbury and Wednesbury – already has one of England’s fattest populations. The NHS says 40 per cent of children there leave primary school overweight or clinically obese.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Sandwell in the West Midlands has come bottom in an exercise survey .\\nThe borough, described as stuck in a 'lazy rut',  has an obesity epidemic .\\nBy contrast, those in the Scilly Isles were found to be the most active .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThe vast majority of Manchester United fans want David de Gea to sign a new contract rather than see him used in any swap deal for Gareth Bale, according to a new poll.

The Spaniard, who has 18 months left on his contract, has been linked with Real Madrid and reports over the weekend suggested the goalkeeper could be used in an exchange that would see Bale move to Old Trafford.

MUST asked: 'If you had a straight choice to either keep David de Gea or sell him as part of a player exchange deal for Gareth Bale with Real Madrid, what would you choose to do?' Twelve hours after posing the question, MUST said 'over 99 per cent' of the 600-plus fans who responded said they would prefer to keep De Gea.

On Tuesday, video surfaced of Abdullah Elmir, 17, who fled Australia back in June to join the terror group in Syria, telling his mother he was going fishing. In the video posted on YouTube, Elmir - going by the name of Abu Khaled – makes threats to Australia and the rest of the Western world and also takes aim at Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Wanted terrorist Mohamed Elomar could have appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video alongside a Sydney teenager . But a day later, speculation about the identity of a man who appeared alongside the teenager mounted and The Sydney Morning Herald reported intelligence officers were now looking closely at the video to determine if the man seen standing to the right of Elmir is the notorious extremist. When asked by Daily Mail Australia if he thought the man in question was Elomar, Dr Jamal Rifi - a friend of the former boxer's family - said: 'I believe he is.' Dr Rifi also added he had not spoken with the Elomars. 'They are overseas and I have no way in contacting them,' he said. Intelligence agencies are looking to confirm if Elomar (pictured) appears in the 1.43 minute video . Fairfax Media has been told intelligence agencies were inspecting the video and chief among their concerns was the man standing closest to Elmir is the wanted terrorist who has close ties with another extremist, Khaled Sharrouf. Earlier this year, Sharrouf caused a worldwide stir when he posted photos on Twitter of his son proudly holding up a severed head in Syria. Warrants for the arrest of Elomar and Sharrouf were issued by the Australian Federal Police in July. In the recently emerged footage, Elmir is flanked by his Islamic State comrades with the well-known black and white flag and brandishing a weapon. Elomar is one of two notorious extremists the Australian Federal Police have put arrest warrants out for in July . The jihadist claimed IS were going to put a 'black flag on top of Buckingham Palace' and the White House. 'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he stated. As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. Throughout, the man believed to Elomar alternates his gaze from Elmir and in front of him. His face remains expressionless and the only time he shows any emotion is when he joins in chanting with his brothers-in-arms at the conclusion of the video. The man holds a rifle in front of his body with both hands.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"A video surfaced of Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, on Tuesday .\\nIntelligence personnel are trying to confirm if Mohamed Elomar is in it .\\nElomar is one of two extremists the AFP issued a warrant for in July .\\nDr Jamal Rifi - a friend of the suspect terrorist's family - believes it is him .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nOne freight train rear-ended another Friday afternoon, sending debris into a passing third train, authorities in Porter County, Indiana, said. Firefighters put out flames among the jumble of derailed cars. Two crew members on the train that struck the back of the other suffered non-life threatening injuries, officials told CNN. CSX said it appeared there were no significant leaks or spills of hazardous materials, \"but inspections of all loaded and empty hazardous materials cars are under way,\" it said in a statement. The three-train accident occurred about 1:15 p.m. Friday about 11 miles northeast of Valparaiso, said David James of the county's highway department. The first train, with two engines and 77 cars, was stopped on the westbound tracks, said Sgt. Larry LaFlower of the Porter County Sheriff's Department. CSX said it was investigating why the first train was stopped. A second train, with two engines and 60 cars, hit it from behind, LaFlower told CNN. The third train, with 48 cars, was moving on a parallel track. \"It struck the wreckage and derailed itself,\" the sheriff's spokesman said. He did know which direction that train was moving in. James said he did not know what speeds the trains may have been traveling. \"The trains carried a wide variety of freight, including three rail cars of flammable products,\" CSX said in a statement. \"Also in the incident are a number of empty hazardous materials cars.\" The train struck from behind was carrying empty ethanol tankers, according to LaFlower. The county's hazardous materials team was on the scene, and residents of about 50 homes were evacuated, authorities said. CSX said it was assisting officials with the evacuation. James said the stretch of railroad was in an agricultural section of the county. \"It's been like a spring day here,\" he said of weather conditions. CSX said it was still determining the total number of derailed cars. The accident occurred near county roads 550 East and 600 North. The National Transportation Safety Board arrived later Friday and was leading the investigation.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"CSX said there appears to have been no significant leaks or spills .\\nOne train rear-ended another, causing it to jackknife, authorities said .\\nTwo injuries are reported .\\nAbout 50 nearby households are evacuated as a precaution .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nPUBLISHED: . 17:52 EST, 6 August 2012 . | .

Edward Bogunovich initially denied the charges, telling ABC News, 'I didn't even have a pipe. I've got zero plants, and I have papers to prove it,' but later changed his tune to say he had sold the plants the day before police raided his home. In that second, Monday afternoon interview, Bogunovich told ABC he had a notarized document proving the timely sale of the some 414 marijuana plants. Scroll down for video . Busted: Edward Bogunovich, 87, has been charged with exceeding the state limit on the number of cannabis plants he could cultivate for medical use . Meanwhile, Denver Police Det. Christopher . Shotts said Bogunovich presented police with a 'questionable' state medical marijuana license after the Friday raid. Those documents, Shotts wrote in an affidavit obtained by ABC News, provided for the legal growth of 231 marijuana plants between Bogunovich and two others cultivators, who . also happened to be growing plants in his backyard. Bogunovich was growing 183 more plants . than he was allowed, Shotts said in the affidavit. Police seized the . plants, which weighed a combined 461 pounds. ABC News reported the Denver District Attorney’s Office said Bogunovich is charged with cultivating marijuana in excess of 30 plants, and possessing more than 12 ounces of marijuana with intent to distribute more than 100 pounds of marijuana. 'I didn't even have a pipe. I've got zero plants, and I have papers to prove it.' The arrest sparked a protest on ABC News's Facebook page after the organization prominently displayed its story on Bogunovich, there. By Monday evening, nearly 700 people had 'liked' the story, with another 430 more posting comments, the vast majority defending Bogunvich and his actions.

Australian Associated Press . Arts, charities and indigenous education will be bolstered by a $200 million grant from the Packer family and Crown Resorts. Gretel Packer says she and billionaire brother James learnt a lot about philanthropy from their parents, the late media tycoon Kerry Packer, and mother Roslyn. The National Philanthropic Fund, is a ten-year commitment by the Crown Resorts Foundation and the Packer Family Foundation. James Packer said the $200 million philanthropic fund will support people from disadvantaged backgrounds . Gretel Packer, James' sister, said both her and her brother were always interested in starting a philanthropic fund . Ms Packer, who is the Packer Family Foundation chair, said it will 'contribute towards strengthening communities in Australia and developing our artistic future'. Crown Resorts chairman James Packer says the fund will support opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The pair has set up a $200 million National Philanthropic Fund to follow the example of their late father, media tycoon Kerry Packer, and mother Roslyn. 'Philanthropy has always been part of our family life, sometimes private, sometimes public, but always there,' Gretel Packer said at the fund's launch on Tuesday, where she was joined by her mother and daughter Francesca. 'My parents have been wonderful role models for James and I in that regard, and in so many other ways, and we appreciate their example so much. 'We have always intended to make a large philanthropic commitment, and today we are in the position to fulfil that promise.' The $200 million is a 10-year commitment from the Packer family and casino group Crown Resorts, which will be split between arts organisations and charities. 'Today's announcement commits us to another decade of financial support for organisations which work tirelessly to deliver services, assistance and opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds,\" Crown Resorts chairman James Packer said in a statement. The Salvation Army, National Centre of Indigenous Excellence and the Exodus and Father Bob Maguire foundations stand to benefit, while the Melbourne Theatre Company was one of the first arts organisations named a beneficiary, receiving $2.5 million over the next five years.

A helping paw: A faithful dog pushes his elderly owner's wheelchair through floodwater . The clip was uploaded to YouTube last week. Some users point out that no one had stopped to help the man. Others have suggested the dog may be simply hanging on to its owner rather than pushing him. The only clue to the location is the fact that the video is Russian. However Russia has remained largely unaffected by the recent floods which have brought chaos to large parts of central Europe, suggesting the clip may have been filmed some time ago. Good boy: Some YouTube users have commented on the fact no one had stopped to help the man . In April, hundreds of people were forced from their homes in Russia’s Voronezh and Saratov regions after rivers flooded due to record snowfalls. The torrential weather this spring has sent the Elbe, the Danube and other rivers such as the Vltava and the Saale overflowing their banks. The resulting floods have caused extensive damage in central and southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary.

In just six months there were 45,476 errors with such serious consequences, including incorrect diagnosis and patients given the wrong treatment or drug. Of these, 1,958 led to death and 43,518 resulted in significant harm. NHS hospitals have been told to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis and surgery in the wrong area. When near misses are also taken into account, the data from NHS England shows there was a total of 725,314 safety incidents between April and September 2013, though the majority were very minor. The figure is nine per cent higher than the previous six months. Officials said this is because staff are being more honest – not that care has got worse. But campaigners said the findings were probably an underestimate as many trusts still do not own up to every mistake. Since 2010 all NHS hospitals have been obliged to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis, surgery in the wrong area or treatment being given too slowly. But in the past some staff have not owned up to such mistakes for fear of legal action by patients or relatives. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans in March for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years . Peter Walsh, of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘These figures are a timely reminder that there is an awful long way to go. ‘It is surprising how much error actually happens. 'Most experts believe that there is still very significant under-reporting so the real figures are probably worse.’ He said that studies had estimated that as many as one in ten patients admitted to hospital were involved in a patient safety incident, although this included other Western countries. ‘We need to get the culture right and have a regulation system that’s fit for purpose,’ he said. In March health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years. They include closer monitoring of hospitals as well the recruitment of extra staff specifically tasked with cutting down on harm. Dr Mike Durkin, NHS England’s director of patient safety, said it was ‘hugely encouraging’ that more incidents were being reported as it showed staff were ‘increasingly comfortable with speaking openly about mistakes and learning from error’.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"45,000 NHS errors with serious consequences recorded in six months .\\nOf these 1,958 led to death according to figures produced by NHS England .\\n725,314 safety incidents in six months last year, up nine per cent .\\nOfficials say majority minor and claim increase down to staff honesty .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities. \"He completely bypassed TSA screening,\" San Diego Harbor Police Chief John Bolduc said. \"He was in a public area and went out an emergency fire door, which gave him access to the tarmac.\" Marc Duncan, 38, was paroled from jail Monday night, according to San Diego County Sheriff's Department records. He had been serving time for theft. After it was opened, the emergency door alarm sounded, and Bolduc said police were on site in four minutes, but by then Duncan had blended in with other passengers. He allegedly boarded a 30-seat United Express aircraft operated by SkyWest, which was heading to Los Angeles, according to airline spokesman Wes Horrocks. The flight attendant realized she had too many passengers, Nicholas Blasgen, a passenger on the plane told CNN affiliate KGTV. \"They said, 'What is your count?' She said this is my count, and they said that is wrong.\" The passengers got off the plane and their luggage was searched. \"They had us put all the bags out, they separated the bags by enough distance and had the dog go over everything,\" Blasgen said. Duncan was identified and arrested. He is being held in the San Diego jail and is scheduled to be in court Thursday. \"I still can't, in the world, understand how this happened,\" Blasgen said. \"It sounds like they just have lax security or not enough management. Something was going wrong.\" The Harbor Police chief said they will examine this incident and find out where to make security improvements. \"The guy did breach security, but he was caught,\" Bolduc said. \"We have multiple layers of security built into our airports, as you know, and the backup systems were able to catch this guy.\" \"Security of airports is a shared responsibility, and airports and airlines are required to adhere to TSA-approved security standards.\" TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said in a statement. \"TSA has initiated an investigation and if necessary, will take appropriate action.\" CNN's Todd Sperry contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Hours after leaving jail, man boards plane with no ticket .\\nPolice say he bypassed TSA and went out an emergency exit .\\nPassenger says everyone left the plane, bags were searched before man was found .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate was called to order for 11 seconds on Wednesday as the last political scuffle of the year between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress played out. Democratic senators will hold short \"pro forma\" sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday last week, but Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments -- a constitutional mechanism that allows the president, during congressional recesses, to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. He spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of \"pro forma\" sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects. Similar sessions were conducted over the Thanksgiving recess. Webb also did the duty Friday, but he won't be the only senator tasked with presiding over the shortened sessions. Other Democrats -- including Sens.

A chivalrous manner, respectfulness, politeness and good self-presentation are all traditional gentlemanly traits. But It seems what defines a gentleman now varies greatly from person to person. Thanks to the popularity of . international best seller Fifty Shades Of Grey, one in ten women between the ages of 25 and 54 - . the ultimate 'mummy porn' market - consider cold and complicated . Christian Grey the most perfect fictional gentleman. EL James' literary trilogy, Fifty Shades Of Grey, left, brought to life Christian Grey, who was voted most perfect fictional gentleman by one in ten women aged 25 to 54, but Mr Darcy, played by Colin Firth, right, came top . But Pride And Prejudice's dashing Mark Darcy - who was initially similarly cold and complicated to Elizabeth Bennett - won the most votes overall, and has been voted the perfect fictional gentleman overall in the nationwide poll of British women. Jane Austen's upper-crust character, brought to life by actor Colin Firth in the 1995 hit BBC mini-series, was named number one by almost a third (29.60 per cent) of British women polled. He was followed by suave British spy James Bond (12.4 per cent), first made world famous by handsome Scot Sean Connery in the 1962 movie Dr. No. Five other actors went on to play the debonair secret agent, with Daniel Craig the latest with his most recent box office smash Skyfall. James Bond, most recently played by Daniel Craig, came in second with 12.4 per cent .

The qualities that make a gentleman are timeless and classic, just like the celebrities that came top of our research.'

A newly-crowned carnival princess has been stripped of her title after organisers spotted an 'inappropriate' piercing on her neck. Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, was chosen to represent Teynham earlier this month and was due to make her first public appearance at Sittingbourne Carnival next month. But this week the teenager was sacked from the job for the piercing at the back of her neck, which organisers saw on her Facebook page. Axed: Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, who was stripped of her carnival princess title for her metal bar neck piercing . Fuming, Miss Lightfoot said there had been 'no mention' of piercings when she was awarded the role, something the organisers admit. The teen said she would not have had the piercing if she had known it would cost her the title, but did admit to having a tattoo, despite being underage. Miss Lightfoot said: 'I signed a contract and it didn't say anything about piercings so I never imagined I'd get sacked for it. 'I had a tattoo clearly on show when I was selected and no one seemed to mind that, so I didn't think twice about the piercing. 'Being in a carnival means everything to me. I have always wanted to do it.' Honour: Miss Lightfoot's mother Jodie said it had been her daughter's dream to represent the town of Teynham in the carnival line-up . Miss Lightfoot has offered to replace the metal bar with a transparent one or to take it out completely but she was told by organisers that it was too late. Miss Lightfood's mother, Jodie, 33, said: 'It was her dream. It is so unfair they have taken it away from her.' Teynham carnival chairman, Terry West, said: 'I saw the picture and decided it wasn't satisfactory for a girl representing Teynham, so the only thing I could do was to take away her sash. 'You hope the girls will set an example as they are meeting mayors, MPs and councillors. I don't think a neck piercing is appropriate. 'Unfortunately she has ruined it for herself. But she is welcome to try again next year - without the piercing.' Mr West admitted he had never specified a policy on body piercings but would formulate new rules for next year's court.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Sharlie Lightfoot said there had been 'no mention' of piercings when she was awarded role .\\nTeynham carnival chairman Terry West said the teen had 'ruined it for herself'\\nMiss Lightfood wears a metal bar that goes through back of her neck .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis glided to a picture-perfect landing Friday morning under bright, sunny skies at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The seven-person crew returned after an 11-day mission to deliver key spare parts to prolong the life of the international space station. The original six-member crew, with flight engineer Nicole Stott -- who launched in August -- returned amid sunny, clear Florida weather. \"Couldn't have picked a clearer day,\" Cndr. Charles Hobaugh said as the shuttle approached the runway. Mission Control told Hobaugh that the landing was a \"picture-perfect end\" to the mission. \"Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole,\" Mission Control said. Stott had spent 87 days on the international space station, according to NASA. About an hour after the shuttle landed, the crew transport vehicle moved alongside the orbiter access hatch on Atlantis' port side, NASA said on its Web site. With the crew hatch opened, the astronauts left the orbiter to enter the vehicle. It contains beds and comfortable seats so the astronauts can receive a brief medical checkup before they step onto the tarmac, NASA said. The crew's mission included three space walks and installation of two platforms to the station's backbone. The platforms will hold spare parts that will sustain station operations after the shuttles are discontinued. NASA said the parts the crew delivered will add years to the station's life after the space shuttle fleet is retired next year. Some of the parts are for systems that keep the station from overheating or tumbling through space, NASA said. During the mission, the crew celebrated Thanksgiving while they prepared for landing. They dined on smoked turkey, green beans, mushrooms, cornbread dressing and candied yams, according to NASA. Russia will take over supplying the international space station. On this mission, Atlantis also marked a 6 pound, 13 ounce development. Astronaut Randy Bresnik welcomed a daughter from space, the second time a baby has been born to a U.S. astronaut on a mission. Mike Fincke's daughter was born in June 2004 while he was aboard the international space station, NASA said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"NEW: Mission Control to crew: \\\"Everybody, welcome back to Earth\\\"\\nNEW: Crew lands at 9:44 a.m. ET Friday after 11-day mission to international space station .\\nCrew's mission included three spacewalks and installation of two platforms .\\nCrew's Thanksgiving meal included smoked turkey, green beans and cornbread dressing .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Almost all the details had been agreed on a March 28 fight that would have brought an end to Froch’s stellar career. But Sportsmail can reveal that an injury three weeks into his training camp has forced Froch to temporarily scrap his plans. His promoter Eddie Hearn is already in talks to rearrange the fight with dates considered in late April and early June. Carl Froch (right) will have to wait for his chance to realise his dream of fighting in Las Vegas . Froch has not fought since he knocked out George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley last year . Hearn said: ‘Carl is devastated but given the scale of the fight and the fact it may be his last, he didn’t want to take any half measures by fighting injured. ‘We were very close to concluding negotiations so as you can imagine it was heartbreaking for Carl to make the call. But we are already looking to reschedule the fight. ‘Everyone knows Carl’s desire to fight in Vegas so we are doing what we can to make it happen. I fully believe it will happen, but he rightly does not want to go into what might be his last fight with an injury.’ Rumours of Froch’s retirement spread on social media on Sunday evening after Froch tweeted a picture of a pair of gloves hanging up. A deal for Froch to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (right) had been close before he suffered his injury . Chavez has not fought since winning his rematch with Brian Vera in Texas last March . Hearn insisted the WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion’s priority remains one last fight, having last fought in his remarkable Wembley rematch win against George Groves in May. Froch had reiterated his hopes for a Vegas fight earlier this month, saying: ‘Dare I say it, but we’re nearly there with the Chavez fight in Las Vegas which we’ve long talked about.' But he said on Monday: 'I'm disappointed to have to let this opportunity go but at this stage in my career I have to make every fight count. 'I will get some treatment and then we will look to make this fight or another big fight in the early summer.'

Teenage drivers who listen to rock or rap music are more likely to drive badly or be involved in a crash, a study found. Young motorists made a greater number of errors and miscalculations while driving with their aggressive, fast-paced and loud music on, according to research from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. But when soothing tunes were played motoring behaviour actually improved, the survey discovered. Men in particular made more frequent and serious mistakes listening to their favourite tunes than their less aggressive, female counterparts, the researchers noted. Risk: Teens who listen to loud, aggressive music while behind the wheel are more likely to be involved in a crash or drive badly, a study found (File photo) The BGU study evaluated 85 young novice drivers accompanied by a researcher/driving instructor. Each driver took six challenging 40-minute trips; two with music from their own playlists; two with background music designed to increase driver safety (easy listening, soft rock, light jazz), and two additional trips without any music. The study was conducted by BGU Director of Music Science Research Warren Brodsky and researcher Zack Slor to assess distraction by measuring driver deficiencies (miscalculation, inaccuracy, aggressiveness, and violations) as well as decreased vehicle performance. When the teen drivers listened to their preferred music, virtually all (98 percent) demonstrated an average of three deficient driving behaviors in at least one of the trips. Dangers: Young men are particularly susceptible to seeing their driving standards deteriorate if they listen to their preferred music. (Picture posed by model) Nearly a third of those (32 percent) required a a sudden verbal warning or command for action, and 20 percent needed an assisted steering or braking maneuver to prevent an imminent accident. These errors included speeding, tailgating, careless lane switching, passing vehicles and one-handed driving. Without listening to any music, 92 percent made errors. However, when driving with an alternative music background designed by Brodsky and Israeli music composer Micha Kisner, deficient driving behaviors decreased by 20 percent. 'Most drivers worldwide prefer to listen to music in a car and those between ages 16 to 30 choose driving to pop, rock, dance, hip-hop and rap,' Brodsky explains. 'Young drivers also tend to play this highly energetic, fast-paced music very loudly - approximately 120 to 130 decibels.' 'Drivers in general are not aware that as they get drawn-in by a song, they move from an extra-personal space involving driving tasks, to a more personal space of active music listening.' The Israel National Road Safety Authority funded the study which will be published in the October issue of Accident Analysis and Prevention.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Young men are particularly prone to errors when listening to preferred music .\\n98 per cent of drivers made mistakes while listening to their favourite tunes .\\nSoothing music reduced bad driving by 20%, Israeli study found .\\nDrivers 'get drawn-in by a song', according to Ben-Gurion University survey .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Rapper Young Jeezy allegedly beat up his teenage son and threatened to kill him during an argument 15 months ago.

He then allegedly threw him against a wall and onto the floor before kicking him in the head. \"The juvenile stated his father stated to him 'I'll put a bullet in your head right now,'\" the report said.

New rides such as Space Mountain were opened in 1995 and a second park - the Walt Disney Studios Park - opened to mark its 10th birthday. Now it has celebrated its 20th anniversary. However, it was revealed in April 2012 that the park owed a staggering £1.6billion - and it would take at least 12 years to pay off the debt. Last month a 5,000-strong petition was launched against the park, claiming it was 'falling apart', amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows.

Meulensteen was previously employed by United under Sir Alex Ferguson and enjoyed great success at the club before he left following the appointment of David Moyes last summer. Since then the Dutch coach has had two short and troubled spells as a manager at Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia and Fulham in the Premier League. Comeback: Rene Meulensteen has expressed a desire to return to Manchester United next season . Rejected: But new United boss Louis van Gaal will bring his own staff to Old Trafford . Meulensteen has been out of work since his departure from Fulham in February but he has revealed a desire to return to Old Trafford to work under countryman Van Gaal. However, the Holland boss has rejected that plan and will bring his own coaches to United. 'I would have been keen to go back,' Meulensteen said at the release of the LMA Annual Castrol European Managers and Coaches Survey. Partnership: Meulensteen assisted Sir Alex Ferguson during a period of great success at United . 'I spent 12 years at what is a fantastic club and never left Man United because I fell out with anyone there. 'But they've chosen to appoint Louis van Gaal and he has decided to bring in his own people so that is not an option. 'Have I spoken to Van Gaal? Yes, I know that is the case - it has been confirmed to me.' He added: 'It is disappointing. When you spend 12 years at a club the size of Manchester United, working in every department - not least for five years with the first team which were the most successful in the history of the club - of course you are disappointed. No 2: Ryan Giggs will be Van Gaal's assistant at Old Trafford next season . 'There aren't many coaches who have spent so much time with one club as I have.' Meulensteen remains keen to try his hand at management again despite bad experiences last season. 'I am definitely keen to get back into it,' he said. 'I've had an experience not many coaches have had because I worked in a very professional environment at United with a lot of stability and then the last 12 months have been the complete opposite. 'But it hasn't put me off at all, it only makes me stronger and more aware.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Former Manchester United assistant told his services will not be needed .\\nHad been employed under Sir Alex Ferguson .\\nLouis van Gaal will bring in his own staff .\\nRyan Giggs will be an assistant at Old Trafford next season .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nPUBLISHED: . 08:25 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:25 EST, 24 October 2012 . Britain is a nation of bargain hunters, with the savviest among us spending up to 130 days of our life searching for the ultimate value-for-money deal. Hit by major recession, Brits are increasingly going to remarkable lengths to save money. A decade ago customers spent an average of five minutes contemplating prices, but many of today's shoppers spend at least 20 minutes in the aisles - and nine per cent of keen bargain hunters take a calculator with them. The ultimate bargain hunter David Dickinson, left, and British supermodel Kate Moss, right, has only popcorn to her shopping list . Research conducted by budget retailer Poundland shows that over 56 per cent of British families have cut back more than half of their weekly spend since recession hit. Jim McCarthy, CEO at Poundland, who conducted the research into weekly spending habits, said: 'More than ever, the pressure is on shoppers to make their money stretch further as they spend increasing amounts of time and energy worrying about how to avoid going over budget. 'Poundland attracts savvy shoppers who know what a real bargain looks like. With every item priced at just £1, there won't be any nasty surprises at the checkout.' With shoppers ditching luxuries such as expensive clothes, customers will be swarming to bargain basements such as this flagship Primark store on Oxford Street . Three quarters of shoppers have ditched luxuries such as clothes, and almost half of UK families have stopped purchasing air fresheners. Thirsty adults are also leaving temptation at the door, with 44 per cent omitting alcohol from their baskets. Thanks to the recession, Britain has . seen a sharp decline in the amount of 'fun' family purchases or things . that will 'make the kids smile'. Mr McCarthy continued: 'It's a sad reality that families are cutting back on 'treat' items and sticking to the real essentials. Yet while over 90 per cent of us visit 156 stores annually in order to bag the best bargains, the survey also reveals that we Brits are not half as strict or savvy as we could be. Nearly half (44 per cent) of families said they don't add up the total of their basket as they go around the store and just 'hope for the best' when they get to the checkout. Moreover, 90 per cent of people who write a grocery list then don’t stick to it.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Due to recession, 56% of British families have halved their weekly spend .\\nAnd 44% now omit alcohol from their shopping baskets .\\nAnd 5% would even damage an item in store to get a discount .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

It was yet unclear if alcohol was involved in the incident. Kelvin Lavizzo has been charged with murder and was being held at the Hamilton County Jail on $1million bond. An initial court appearance was expected on Tuesday. Last year, the two brothers and their sister had been indicted over a scheme where they allegedly stole $150,000 in welfare benefits. One neighbor Miles Jones spoke highly of his friend who was a skilled auto-mechanic. He told Fox 19: 'He was a good guy, a family man.

Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 06:16 EST, 10 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:16 EST, 10 April 2012 . A mother has hit out at school teachers for excluding her teenage son from classes over his Wayne Rooney-style haircut. Billy Davies was told his hairstyle was too ‘extreme’ for the classroom because it is shaved into a ‘V’ shape at the back - similar to one previously sported by the Manchester United striker. Teachers at Park Community School in Havant, Hampshire, decided to bar the 15-year-old from all of his lessons until his hair grows back. 'Extreme': Billy Davies' hairstyle was branded 'extreme' by teachers and he was told he could not join lessons because it breached uniform policy at Park Community School in, Havant . But furious Jackie Davies said: ‘The school is being pedantic. His hair isn’t extreme at all. ‘I could understand if he was going to school with purple or blue hair but that’s not the case.’ The teen, who lives with his parents in Havant, said: ‘It’s stupid because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my hair. ‘It’s fashionable and a lot of my friends have the same sort of haircut, yet I’m the only one who has been punished. ‘Some of the students even have pink hair. Style icons: Haircuts, like the ones sported by Chelsea's Raul Meireles, left, and Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, have been banned by the school . ‘I . feel gutted because now I’m not in lessons with my friends and it’s . going to be harder to concentrate on my work being sat alone.’ The youngster now has to do his work in a room by himself during lesson time. If he needs any help then he has to go and ask a teacher before returning to the room once he has had assistance. The schoolboy has had the haircut for a . year but letters were sent out by the school in September which warned . parents it would not tolerate ‘extreme’ hairstyles. Billy says he never got a copy of the letter and argues that his hairstyle is not ‘extreme’. Excluded: Billy Davies does not see any problem with his hairstyle but has been banned him from lessons until it grows out . Last year, parents began a campaign to get regulations relaxed at the school after scores of pupils were banned from lessons. They felt their children were being punished for spiking up their hair with gel and having it subtly coloured. Headteacher Chris Anders said: ‘We’re an outstanding school and proud of our high standards. ‘Parents are well aware of the uniform policy and support it. ‘It’s . always a shame when students do not follow rules. But as adults working . with children and young people, we know it is important to be clear . about the consequences of actions and to follow through when rules are . broken.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Billy Davies, 15, has to do work in room by himself until hair grows back .\\nSchool says style breaches uniform policy .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nSouthampton have re-launched a bid to sign Atletico Madrid defender Toby Alderweireld on loan and he is thought to favour a move to St Mary's over Newcastle.

The company announced yesterday that it is committed to giving its customers the healthier ingredients that they have been asking for and will therefore be swapping the artificial flavors and certified colors currently found in its beloved candy for natural alternatives, 'without affecting taste or increasing the price' of its chocolates. 'We never compromise on taste,' Leslie Mohr, the company’s nutrition, health and wellness manager, said in a statement about the changes, which will affect more than 250 products, including Nestle Crunch, Butterfinger and Baby Ruth. Healthy swap: Swiss food company Nestle has announced that will be the first major US candy manufacturer to remove artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate, including the brand's Crunch bars . She added: 'When making these changes to more than 75 recipes, maintaining the great taste and appearance consumers expect from the chocolate brands they know and love is our number one priority.' For example, the Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of Nestle's Butterfinger bars will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees. Meanwhile the brand's Crunch bars will soon be made with natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial vanillin. Nestle looked into making the changes after its internal research indicated that US consumers would prefer popular candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors.

Quick fix: The Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of this Nestle Butterfinger bar will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees .

Nestle is also in the process of removing caramel coloring from its chocolate products. 'Our commitment to remove artificial flavors and certified colors in our chocolate candy brands is an important milestone,' said Doreen Ida, the company’s US president. 'We know that candy consumers are interested in broader food trends around fewer artificial ingredients.'

Authorities in Marseille wanted beggars to wear the badges, which would have carried information such as their personal details and any health issues, so they could be easily identifiable. But the proposals provoked outrage across France from human rights groups and even government ministers with some comparing the badges to the Star of David Jews were forced to sew on to their clothes during the Nazi era. Homeless man Arnaud shows off one of the yellow triangle ID badges authorities in Marseille were going to make beggars wear . The six-pointed yellow star was forced upon the Jews by Nazis in the Reich to wear to mark them out. French group La Ligue des droits de l'Homme said they were troubled by the badge and its resemblance to the yellow star that had to be worn by Jews. While social affairs minister Marisol Touraine told Le Parisien newspaper: 'Forcing homeless people to carry a yellow triangle indicating the illnesses they might have is outrageous. You don't point the finger at the poorest. The plan provoked outrage with human rights groups and even government ministers comparing the ID tags to the Star of David badges Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany . Earlier this week demonstrators gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the plans, which were eventually dropped today . The ID tags for homeless people were compared to the yellow Star of David badges worn by Jews in Nazi Germany, pictured . 'You don't write their illnesses on their clothes. Medical confidentiality, in particular, is a fundamental right. I want this local initiative to be stopped.' Demonstrators also gathered outside the City Hall of Marseille to protest against the badges which they said were discriminatory. They held up signs and placards with one reading '1933-1945 Never Again', with the yellow triangle and Star of David emblem next to it. Council officials had tried to defend the plan saying they were only to help emergency services if they have to come to the aid of a homeless person. Over 100 of the cards had also been distributed around the city. But today, council of France's second largest city, bowed down to pressure and announced that they would be scrapping the plan.

Danon Edwards, 33, of Syracuse, is accused of breaking a police officer's jaw after punching him at the scene of a traffic accident in May. In court, Edwards' lawyer said his client's military service from 1999 to 2003 left him emotionally scarred and unable to work. His military records however show during his time in the Marines he was a 'food service specialist', Syracuse.com has reported. The Marines have said they have no records of Edwards being deployed overseas, according to the Associated Press. Authorities allege Edwards hit North Syracuse Officer Robert Florian several times following a four-vehicle crash, which Edwards was involved in. He appeared in court on July 8, where his lawyer Chris Gaiser said his service 'may have had an effect on his emotional stability', according to Syracuse.com. The judge, who had freed Edwards on $50,000 bail, ordered a mental health evaluation for the former marine. He is due to next appear in court on Friday. Last week it was reported that a U.S. Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly . bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance after . spending more than three months in a Mexican jail. Military records show during his time in the Marines, Edwards was a 'food service specialist' A Mexican judge ordered Sgt.

Trailing 15-17 deep into the fourth quarter, Giants quarterback Eli Manning found Ahmad Bradshaw for what proved to be the winning touchdown. It still left the Patriots with one final chance to move ahead but their star quarterback Tom Brady saw his final 'Hail Mary' pass go uncaught. It was the fourth Super Bowl triumph for the Giants, repeating their 2008 success over Brady's Patriots. Manning was named MVP for a superb performance, capped by his coolness under pressure in their final winning drive, his 38-yard pass to Mario Marringham laying the foundations for victory. \"It just feels good to win a Super Bowl no matter where you are or what stadium it is,\" Manning said. The Giants had made the more confident start and had the first score of the night as Brady made an incomplete pass from his own endzone and referee John Parry awarded a safety and two points to the team from New York. Super Bowl XLVI as it happened . It got better for the Giants soon afterwards as Manning connected with Victor Cruz for the opening touchdown. Lawrence Tynes added the extra point and they were ahead 9-0. The Patriots responded with a field goal from Stephen Gostkowski and were slowly working their way back into the game. It culminated in Brady being instrumental in a 96-yard drive, tied for the longest in Super Bowl history, as he finally found the excellent Danny Woodhead for a touchdown. Gostkowski made no mistake for the extra point and the Patriots were 10-9 to the good at the half. After the halftime entertainment supplied by Madonna, it was the Patriots who were calling the tune and Brady continued in superlative form as he set up Aaron Hernandez to run in seven yards for their second touchdown. It had been a 79-yard drive and on the way Brady made it 14 straight completions, breaking a Super Bowl record held by Joe Montana. Tynes, brought up in Scotland and one of several international players in Super Bowl XLVI, kept the Giants within range as he responded with a 38-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 17-12. Brady was sacked on the next Patriots drive, the Giants regained possession and Tynes converted again for a 33-yard field goal. So at 17-15 heading into the final quarter, it was anyone's game in keeping with the pre-match predictions of a close contest. But it was Manning who kept his nerve under pressure as the Giants claimed the biggest prize in the NFL after trailing at halftime and looking second best to the earlier brilliance of Brady. \"At halftime I said we can play better than this. They agreed,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \"We came out energized in the second half and the rest is history.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"New York Giants win Super Bowl XLVI .\\nGiants beat New England Patriots 21-17 in Indianapolis .\\nWinning touchdown from Ahmad Bradshaw .\\nFourth Super Bowl triumph for the Giants as Eli Manning named MVP .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Thai authorities are considering the construction of a super-express waterway through Bangkok to prevent future floods similar to the one that has crippled the Thai capital and brought manufacturing in other parts of the country to a standstill. A team of disaster experts from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok is now investigating permanent solutions to the disaster that has left hundreds dead. \"One of the urgent solutions is a super-express floodway,\" Thanawat Jarupongsakul, from the university's Unit for Disaster and Land Information Studies, told the Bangkok Post. Under the plan, existing natural canals -- some of them more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) long -- would be linked in a 200-km \"super-highway\" that would divert the course of floodwaters from the north. The super-canal would hold 1.6 billion cubic meters of water and drain run-off at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per second -- the equivalent of two and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools a second. \"This idea is much cheaper than digging a new river as a floodway,\" Thanawat said. He said the proposed scheme would involve the construction of a kilometer-wide exclusion zone next to the floodway to prevent properties from being inundated, and a raised highway on both side of the canal. The super-express floodway would then drain upstream run-off directly into the sea. The university team is also looking at other flood-prevention measures such as a better early-warning system, improved water resource management, a flood tax, the use of a flood-risk map for urban development and groundwater-use controls. \"Now, the government must stop [trying to] solve flood problems with political methods,\" Thanawat told the Bangkok Post. He said poor water management rather than excess rain had caused this year's severe flooding, adding that natural swamps in the west of Thailand's Central Plains, which once absorbed water flow, had been developed into industrial and residential areas, blocking the natural floodway. While giant flood tunnels in the Bangkok metropolitan area could drain floodwater from the city, they could not cope with a massive inundation from the north. \"If there is no step forward, foreign investors will eventually disappear from the country and the next generation will be still worried whether flooding will happen or not,\" he said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Thai authorities consider super-express waterway to prevent future floods .\\nUnder the plan, existing natural canals would be linked in 200-km \\\"super-highway\\\"\\nSuper-canal would hold 1.6B cubic meters of water and massively speed drain run-off .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

The Ebola screening system at airports has been toughened up after a nurse who later developed the virus was waived through. Nurse Pauline Cafferkey is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday having spent five weeks treating victims in Sierra Leone. It later emerged that officials at Heathrow had allowed her to board a connecting flight to Glasgow even though she had complained of a fever. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the UK following volunteer work. Until recently, the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling-in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients. But from now on, anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal. Officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours. Pauline Cafferkey, 39, from Glasgow, remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said: 'Pauline's condition has deteriorated to a critical state although she stabilised yesterday and continues to receive the best possible care.'

Rebekah Rorick, who attends Broadalbin-Perth High School in upstate New York, said she wanted to cry when the yearbook committee initially turned down this photo of her hunting . 'My family has always hunted,' she told News10. 'It's something I do with my family, and my dog is my best friend. 'So I decided to put her in the photo. I fell in love with [the picture]. It's my favorite photo of all time right now.' She denies that she was trying to be controversial and says she simply wanted to express herself as other students were allowed to do. Rorick and her dad took her case to the Board of Education on Monday night and argued that the photo was no different from many other senior portraits that highlight student interests. They were also able to present a 2012 yearbook photo which showed a past senior holding a rifle beside a deer. The school board has a policy against weapons, but Superintendent Stephen Tomlinson said he didn't have an issue with this particular photo of Rorick. Rorick denies that she was trying to be controversial and says she simply wanted to express herself as other students were allowed to do . 'She is not holding the gun in a malicious manner. She is not pointing it anywhere. 'It's to me, in my opinion, a nice photograph of a young lady in the Adirondack region that enjoys hunting,' he told News10. The board sided with Rorick and her father, and so the portrait will now appear in the yearbook. 'I was so happy. I could not stop smiling,' she said. 'I felt the board had a lot of courage.

Melbourne clothing and technology label Threadsmiths has created a revolutionary T-shirt that remains waterproof no matter how hard you try to soak it. Made from 100 per cent cotton, the plain white T-shirts called The Cavalier feature a 'hydrophobic' nano-technology application woven in the fabric and capable of repelling most liquids and dirt. A patented technology, unlike other liquid-repelling applications and aerosols which can contain chemicals, the Threadsmiths website states: 'Our shirts emulate the natural hydrophobic properties of the lotus leaf.' Scroll down for video . Melbourne clothing technology company Threadsmiths has created a waterproof T-Shirt using a patented technology . Despite the material's waterproof qualities, the fabric is made from 100 per cent cotton . 'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be.' Still breathable, the Australian invention's technology boosts the material's resistance to water and stains by causing it to simply bead up and roll off the fabric. Creating a natural self-cleaning effect, any residue left on the material can be removed by just wiping or rinsing off it off with water. Lewis Pitchford of the label said the the waterproof technology did not rely on the T-shirts being coated in hydrophobic sprays available in the U.S. such as Ultra-Ever Dry, reported the Herald Sun. The T-shits contain no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals according to the fashion label . The woven technology has been patented and does not rely on the fabric being coated in hydrophobic sprays . 'Most people are pretty amazed when they see it,' he said. While the label currently only produces T-shirts, Mr Pitchford said he welcomed suggestions about what other garments to make using the fabric in the future. There is speculation the fabric could be revolutionary for restaurants and cafes, where spills on tablecloths and aprons are a daily occurrence and also in the medical sector and hospitals, reported Eftm.com.au. Machine washable, the waterproof effect will last for up to 80 washes. The T-shirts are available for men and women and retail for $65 each, while children's T-shirts are coming soon. Lewis Pitchford of Threadsmiths said the label was open to suggestion on what garments to make next .

Alarming statistics show that only just over half of 1200 Australians surveyed always comply with used by dates and less than half of the consumers abide by best before warnings. Dr Michael Eyles, council chair of Food Safety Information Council which was commissioned to do the Newspoll survey, described the results as disturbing. Ignoring cooking instructions creates a particularly high risk of food poisoning from goods with egg products (left) poultry and minced (left) or cubed meats . ‘Frightening is not too strong a word to describe other results, including that only a third (33 per cent) of people always read and comply with storage instructions and a meagre 14 per cent always read and comply with cooking instructions,' Dr Eyles elaborated. While an astounding 86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always read and comply with cooking instructions which is: ‘far too high and creates a serious food poisoning risk, especially for poultry, minced or cubed meats, or egg products,’ Dr Eyles said. Dr Eyles said following storage instructions was essential with perishable food . ‘Refrigerate after opening’, ‘keep frozen’ or ‘refrigerate under 4°C’ must be followed or food poisoning bacteria will grow quickly,’ he warned. 86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always follow cooking instructions while only three in 10 use insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops . Only three in 10 people use insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops . Storage of food in the correct temperature was also an issue with only three in 10 people using insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops. Dr Eyles hoped other shoppers would follow the lead of the smart consumers who had the foresight to take coolers when shopping their cold items. ‘Refrigerated food can warm quickly into the temperature danger zone (5° to 60°C) where food poisoning bacteria can grow,’ he said. ‘This is especially risky for foods that won’t be cooked again such as sliced deli meats, pate, prepared salads, cut fruits and soft cheeses.’ The good news is that more than eight in 10 (83 per cent) of surveyors said the last time they bought refrigerated items it took less than 30 minutes to get the food from the store to their fridge with nearly everyone else getting the food home in under an hour.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"About half of 1200 Australians surveyed always comply with expiry dates .\\nLess than half of the consumers abide by best before warnings .\\n86 per cent don’t always read and comply with cooking instructions .\\nWhile only 14 per cent always follow cooking instructions .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Kevin Signo, who died in a freak accident as he attempted a back-flip while rehearsing a dance with friends . A teenager died after a back-flip went horribly wrong during a break in rehearsals of a traditional dance routine. Kevin Signo, an 18-year-old Baylor University freshman, died Sunday after a bizarre accident as he attempted the acrobatic move when he and his friends took a break from rehearsing traditional dances with the Filipino Students' Association. The pre-biology student from Frisco, Texas, hit his forehead and suffered a fatal spinal injury, according to a justice of the peace who spoke to the Waco Tribune-Herald. His parents, Henry and Jackie Signo, told NBC their son was shy in high school but had thrived socially since arriving at Baylor, in Waco, Texas. The Signos said Kevin dreamed of being a doctor and had signed legal documents to say he was an organ donor because he liked the idea that he could help others in the event of a tragedy. He was an organ donor who had a legal document drawn up, donating his eyes, skin, bones and organs. 'He knew exactly what could be used for and what was important,' Mrs Signo said. Mr Signo added: 'We're very happy to have had him for a short time.' At least two busloads of students from Baylor are expected to make the trip to the funeral, which will take place on Saturday.

The former U21 manager fails to see why the likes of Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers should not be among the senior players included in Gareth Southgate's squad next year, despite them being part of Roy Hodgson's senior set-up. Pearce, now manager of Nottingham Forest, said: 'If you want a successful international side, you're going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments, which I've said time and time again.' Raheem Sterling is one of England's senior players that could feature for the U21 side at Euro 2015 . Arsenal attacker Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another exciting talent who is eligible to play in Czech Republic . Former England U21 boss Stuart Pearce thinks Gareth Southgate should take the strongest possible squad . He believes players gain valuable experience by participating in tournaments through each tier of the national set-up. 'There will be a concern at football clubs, with football managers and the interest of club supporters definitely, but it's where you see the trade-off. 'For me, we've got Jamaal Lascelles in the U21 squad and if Gareth Southgate wants to take him next summer, he can go with my blessing because I think it's right and proper that they play.' Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sterling, pictured on senior duty this week, are both regulars at Arsenal and Liverpool . Arsenal full-back Calum Chambers could also get the call from Southgate having only recently been promoted . Asked if Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers should be picked as Southgate's senior players for Euro 2015, Pearce said he does not think their recent first-team duties should prevent them taking part in the Czech Republic. 'I'm not going to change my tune now. The bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they're age appropriate and available in my opinion and that doesn't change,' he explained. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger does not think dropping Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers to the U21 set-up would be beneficial to the players, particularly with both featuring heavily for the Gunners this season . But Arsene Wenger has questioned whether dropping players from the senior squad to the U21 set-up will have a positive influence on their progression. 'Once a guy has moved to the full national team and you put him down, he's never good,' said Wenger. 'On the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it's better he has a good rest during the summer, but most of the time when they move down they are not completely at their quality.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Ex-England U21 manager Stuart Pearce says Gareth Southgate should take the strongest possible squad to the Czech Republic next summer .\\nThe likes of Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers are all eligible to play for the U21 side at the tournament .\\nPearce thinks such players would gain valuable experience at Euro 2015 .\\nArsene Wenger, however, has questioned the value of sending players that have already graduated to Roy Hodgson's senior set-up .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nEvery morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe.

The 25-year-old Slovenian is a resident of Welwyn Garden City and is awaiting the outcome of his application to become a British citizen. He was eventually swatted away by world No 1 Djokovic, who prevailed 6-3, 6-2. 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena to get his 11th campaign at Melbourne Park under way. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Novak Djokovic wins in straight sets 6-3, 6-2. 6-4 . Novak Djokovic looked in good form as he beat Aljaz Bedene in straight sets . The World No 1 celebrates his victory as he looks to win his fifth Australian Open title . Bedene, who two years ago reached his career-high ranking of 71st, jumped 40 places to his current position at number 116 by reaching the recent Chennai final, where he lost to reigning Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka. And the confidence he took from that performance in India was reflected in the early proceedings as Bedene kept pace with Djokovic until the eighth game. He even drove three successive aces beyond the Serbian, showing no sign of stage fright on the tournament's biggest stadium court. Djokovic was given a test by Bedene but progressed without too many problems . Djokovic's coach watched the world No 1 from the stands of the Rod Laver Arena . Djokovic makes a forehand return to Bedene during their first round match at the Australian Open . Eventually, though, the gulf in class told, with Bedene handing Djokovic a first break point by spearing a forehand long. Djokovic seized the opportunity, albeit in a rather unconvincing fashion when his under-hit smash was returned into the net by Bedene, who might have had time to do better. Slovenian-born Bedene lives in England and has applied to become a British citizen . Djokovic is congratulated by Bedene after his victory in the first round . And in swiftly closing out the set, Djokovic imposed the tempo for the rest of the contest, his tentative start soon forgotten as he raced through the second in 27 minutes and broke decisively in the fifth game of the third to move within sight of victory. A love service game completed the task for a player who despite recent illness looked sharp enough to suggest he will again be a title contender. This was Bedene's seventh appearance in the first round of a grand slam, and he has yet to win a match at the level. British tennis watchers taking a special interest in Bedene's fortunes would not be unfamiliar with such a frustrating run of results.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Novak Djokovic beats Aljaz Bedene 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 .\\nSlovenian-born Bedene lives in Welwyn Garden City and has applied to become a British citizen .\\nWorld No 1 Djokovic has won the Australian Open four times .\\nClick here for more Australian Open news .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium, according to a study that found amazing comparisons between obese people and drug addicts. In the study, a natural brain chemical called enkephalin - an endorphin with similar properties to opium - surged as rats began to eat M&M chocolates. Addictive: Chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium, according to a study that found comparisons between obese people and drug addicts . When a drug was used to stimulate the dorsal neostriatum - the brain area releasing the chemical - the number of M&Ms eaten more than doubled. In the brain, enkephalin binds to molecular ‘receptors’ sensitive to opiate chemicals to reduce pain and produce pleasurable feelings. Previous research mostly linked the dorsal neostriatum to movement, and recent work suggested it also plays a role in reward-driven behaviour. But study leader Dr Alexandra DiFeliceantonio said the extraordinary findings showed comparisons between and drug addicts and the obese. Opium links: The researchers looked at the same brain area which is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes . She said: ‘This (study) means that the brain has more extensive systems to make individuals over-consume rewards than previously thought. 'The same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes' Dr Alexandra DiFeliceantonio . ‘The same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes. ‘It seems likely that our enkephalin findings in rats mean that this neurotransmitter may drive some forms of overconsumption and addiction in people.’ The findings of the University of Michigan researcher and her team have been published in the US journal Current Biology. In their paper, the scientists concluded: ‘Opioid circuitry... could in this way participate in normal motivations and perhaps even in generating intense pathological levels of motivation to overconsume reward in binge eating disorders, drug addiction and related compulsive pursuits.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Study looked at natural brain chemical of enkephalin .\\nIt's an endorphin with similar properties to opium .\\nUS researchers found it surged as rats ate M&Ms .\\nDrug then stimulated brain area releasing chemical .\\nAfter that, number of M&Ms eaten more than doubled .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n'Ointment': David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself . A man who exposed himself to a coach load of schoolgirls while driving along a motorway claimed he was applying ointment to his genitals, a court heard. David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself as he drove past the shocked pupils along the M6 motorway near Rugby, Warwickshire. Acres, 36, was seen with his hand moving 'furiously' on his genitals by the schoolgirls and their teacher, it was said. But he told Warwick Crown Court he was simply rubbing ointment on himself at the time. A statement from Acres' wife said he had had a problem with a sore genital area for some time but had not been to a doctor about it. Acres, of Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, denied indecently exposing his genitals intending someone to see them and be caused alarm or distress in March 2011. But on the day of his trial at Warwick Crown Court he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of outraging public decency by his actions. Denis Desmond, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown were not minded to pursue the allegation that he did it intending the children on the coach to see what he was doing.' However, the prosecution said they did not accept Acres' claim that he was not performing a sex act at the time as the teacher said he had been performing the act 'furiously'. Judge Alan Parker said: 'His case is that he was applying ointment while driving in his car on the M6 motorway. 'The risk assessment that follows needs to be based on either a finding that he was merely applying ointment to himself and gave no thought to the young girls on the coach seeing him, or that he was performing a sexual act; because if he was, it makes it more likely he will do the same in the future.' The case was adjourned for a 'trial of issue' at which the teacher, but not the girls, will be called to give evidence, and Acres was granted bail.

'I just poured gasoline on the floor, set it on fire, went to grab a drink, and came back,' he said. 'Just so you [the media] could get here....for your attention,' he added. The man then walked up to two Rockville police officers and told them he set the fire. They arrested him. The moment of his confession to police was also caught on camera as astonished officers looked on. 'Carlos' also confessed to stunned police at the scene, who immediately took him into custody . Once at the police station, however, 'Carlos' was reportedly less talkative and asked for an attorney. Police say the man was among six people living in the home. No one was injured. Damage to the property is estimated at $400,000 and the house is likely a loss. Local woman Linda Ekizian said there were police cars outside the house fairly often.

Authorities fear the escaped prisoners may now rejoin the fight, giving momentum and a propaganda boost to a movement that has killed thousands of Pakistani officials and ordinary citizens since 2007. The attackers battled their way into the prison before dawn in the city of Bannu close to the Afghan border and near Peshawar. Bannu prison superintendent Zahid Khan said they used explosives and hand grenades to knock down the main gates and two walls. 'They were carrying modern and heavy weapons,' said Mr Khan. 'They fired rockets.' Once inside the building, the attackers headed straight to the area of the prison where death-row prisoners were being kept, he said. Police officer Shafique Khan said they fought with guards for around two hours, setting part of the prison on fire before freeing the 380 inmates, including at least 20 'very dangerous Taliban militants'. The raid took place in Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the early morning hours . Miian Iftikhar Hussain, the provincial information minister, said the militants first set up the roadblocks around the prison and then broke in through the main gate . One escaped prisoner, Adnan Rashid, was on death row for his involvement in an assassination attempt against former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, said Zahid Khan. The prison in Bannu housed 944 inmates. A Taliban spokesman, Asimullah Mehsud, claimed the movement's fighters freed 1,200 of their comrades. The group is known to make exaggerated claims. Where the jail is . Pakistan's military has launched a series of operations against the Pakistani Taliban group in the northwest, where it is strongest and has forged alliances with al-Qaida and other transnational militant movements based there along the Afghan border. The movement is closely linked to the Afghan Taliban, which is battling U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Soldiers and police have killed or arrested hundreds of militants, but the insurgency has proved resilient. Insurgents have carried out suicide bombings and other attacks across the country in retaliation, raising doubts in some quarters over whether the county can survive. Prison breakouts like the one Sunday have been rare. Bannu city is the main gateway to North Waziristan, the most militant-infested region along the border.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Raid took place near the border with Afghanistan .\\nAuthorities fear freed prisoners will join insurgency .\\nAt least 20 described as 'very dangerous' by police .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nVeteran Hull goalkeeper Steve Harper is 'open-minded' about his future.

Ruslan Chagaev (left) lands a powerful left-hander during his win over Nikolai Valuev two years ago. The bout, at Helsinki's Hartwall-Arena, will be the first-ever heavyweight contest on Finnish soil, and will see a pumped-up Valuev going all out to \"settle the score\" against the only man to defeat him in a 51-bout career. Chagaev twice pulled out of scheduled rematches with Valuev last summer due to injury problems, prompting the WBA to vacate the title. Uzbeki southpaw Chagaev has been listed as 'champion in recess' ever since and -- as a result -- has to fight Valuev by the end of June in order to determine the undisputed champion. Valuev reclaimed the vacant belt by defeating American John Ruiz in August and defended his title against Evander Holyfield in December. \"The day has come to settle the score,\" Valuev told a news conference. \"I have been waiting for two years to make amends. Only a victory over Chagaev can put my mind at rest.\" Valuev bounced back with four wins on the spin following his loss to Chagaev in April 2007 but the Russian admits the only scalp that matters is that of the Uzbeki. \"I know everything there is to know about Chagaev,\" said Valuev. \"This is the fourth time I am actually preparing for a fight with him,\" he added, referring to the two postponed fights last year. \"Now is the time to end all this confusion.

Another 59 people were still hospitalized from drinking the toxic liquor, and five were released after treatment, a government newscaster said. Late Monday, Havana hospitals were flooded with people complaining of dizziness and stomach ailments, a statement from the provincial public safety office said. Authorities said they appeared to have consumed a black-market rum brewed with toxic methyl alcohol, commonly found in varnishes and anti-freeze. On a Cuban state TV newscast, doctors said most of the patients were slowly recovering, including those who had temporarily lost their vision from drinking the poisoned rum. \"The vomiting has stopped and so has the great sickness they felt,\" said Dr. Efren Acosta. But Acosta said many patients still suffered from dizziness. Patients interviewed by Cuban state media said they experienced blurred vision and nausea after one drink of what they described as an acrid tasting liquid. They said they sought treatment upon hearing that neighbors and friends had fallen ill. \"I couldn't see,\" Sandy Pons told Cuban government television. \"It was all foggy. The headaches and dizziness are gone now.\" According to the provincial public safety office, investigators traced the illegal alcohol sales to two workers for the government Pharmacy and Foods Institute. Authorities accuse them of stealing the chemicals from a government warehouse. The workers provided the chemicals to a woman who brewed the alcohol and sold it in her neighborhood, the public safety office said. Cuban authorities have not said what charges the people involved in producing the liquor could face, but Cuban President Raul Castro last month called for a greater crackdown on corruption and black market activities.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Poisoned rum brewed in Havana neighborhood claims nine lives, state media say .\\nInvestigators trace the poison to two state workers, public safety office says .\\nThe chemical, methyl alcohol, is commonly found in varnishes and anti-freeze .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Iran tested a missile-launching system and several types of short- and medium-range missiles Sunday, the state-run Press TV said.

But a closer look reveals out-of-place pipes, mysterious pools of water and long hoses that run along the walls of nearby homes. The \"construction workers\" aren't paid laborers either -- they're local residents who have simply walked out of their homes and started hacking into the road. Why? For water. They lift tiles off the pavements and dig until they hit ground water. \"Who would dig up wells if there's enough water? There's just no water,\" said one resident who would only give his surname, Yin. His family had been suffering from water shortages on and off for months until they decided to take matters into their own hands. Growing demand . The Shuimo Community in Haidian district has grown rapidly and authorities have been unable to cope with the growing demand for water. \"We started receiving complaints from residents about water shortages since the end of July,\" said Liu Zhongmin, head of the Water Resources Office in the Department of Water Affairs of Haidian District. \"We're aware of local residents digging wells to get water. These are illegal constructions and should be demolished.\" But any plans to fix the water supply problem have been delayed. \"We don't plan to do anything at this point as it'll spark tensions between us and residents,\" said Liu. He explained that any work on the pipelines in the neighborhood would not be straightforward. The community has grown from 1,000 residents to more than 8,000 in recent years, and new residents have occupied roads where pipelines are buried under their houses, according to Liu. For the near future, residents see only one way out of the situation. \"Everybody knows we're not allowed to dig wells here but what else can we do? Who can solve the problem?\" asks Yin. He adds that a well costs as much as RMB 40,000 (about $6,500) to complete. Freshwater supplies in China have been increasingly strained in recent years. A growing population, industrial development and widespread pollution pushes the lack of freshwater to crisis levels, according to China Water Risk.

Blue tits, great tits and other small garden birds scout for food in the morning but only return to eat it in the late afternoon, a study found. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows them to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators. A full belly in the morning would slow them down in the hunt for food and make them easy prey. Early riser: A foraging Great Tit with a worm in its beak . So they search out food when lean and lithe and then dine in the evening to ensure they have a big enough store of fat to survive through the night. The ‘early bird’ strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in Wytham Woods, near Oxford. The feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them. This revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders’ new locations in the morning.  However, they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in. The researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy, with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night. It is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows the birds to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators . Zoologist Damien Farine said: ‘Birds have to store body fat to avoid starving during the cold winter nights, but this can make them slower and less manoeuvrable so they are more likely to be caught by predators. ‘So there is a trade-off, where birds need to remain lean enough in order to “outrun” their predators, or at least the next slowest bird, during the day but also store enough fat to survive each night.’ Writing in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, he added that the study shows that rather than ‘idly waiting’ to until the afternoon, the birds start searching out food in the morning. ‘Our results show these birds display very different patterns of food discovery in the morning and afternoon; very few new food sources were found during the afternoon, whereas nearly every new food source we put out during the morning was quickly discovered. ‘It supports the idea of an ‘early bird’ strategy of scouting for food early on so they can return to feast a couple of hours before dusk in preparation for a long winter’s night.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Study monitored behaviour of blue tits, great tits and other small .\\nbirds .\\nOxford University team believes strategy allows them to avoid predators .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nHillary Clinton on Tuesday weaved together the national outcry over a recent report detailing U.S. torture abroad and the nationwide protests against recent police killings of unarmed black men. The former secretary of state said the U.S. should reaffirm a ban on torture in \"both policy and law\" and suggested that Congress pass legislation to make the U.S. opposition to torture absolutely clear after a scathing Senate committee report recounting years of torture of terror suspects at the hands of the CIA. \"Today we can say again, in a loud and clear voice, the United States should never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world, not under any future administration or in any future conflict,\" said Clinton, who is expected to launch a 2016 presidential bid. \"If that requires new legislation, then Congress should work with President Obama to quickly enact it, and it should not be an issue of partisan politics.\" Accepting a human rights award from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, Clinton homed in on the importance of putting American values first when it comes to the criminal justice system and in the fight against terrorism. \"It is possible to keep us safe from terrorism and reduce crime and violence without relying on torture abroad or unnecessary force or excessive incarceration at home,\" she said. \"There's no doubt that at home and abroad, America is at our best when our actions match our values.\" Bush era haunts Obama . Clinton invoked the protesters who have mobilized in major U.S. cities to protest the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York, both black men who were unarmed when they were killed by white police officers. \"We can stand up together and say, 'Yes, black lives matter,' \" she said, referring to the rallying cry of demonstrators around the country. Clinton called attention to inequalities in the U.S. between minority groups and whites, noting the \"cruel reality\" that African-American and Hispanic men are much more likely to be searched by police officers, jailed and shot by police officers than white men. She said the country can work to restore trust in the criminal justice system and a balance between rights and security by remembering the police officers who do their jobs right. \"We know that there are so many police officers every day inspiring trust and confidence rather than fear and frustration, honorably doing their duty, putting their lives on the line to save lives, not take them,\" she said.

The amateur videos emerged as a Syrian human rights group reported 1,600 deaths in just 10 days this month. The latest images come from an area taken over by the militant terrorist group the Islamic State, which recently changed its name from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The group is known for killing dozens of people at a time and beheading some. At least three videos posted on YouTube by different people show the grisly scene at a roundabout in the city of Reqqa, where Islamic State militants have been carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts decided by its Sharia, or Islamic law, court. A narrator in one of the videos says the bodies are of Syrian soldiers who were killed by Islamic State fighters. The videos surfaced online along with news that Islamic State took over the Syrian army's 17th Division headquarters, which was considered the Syrian regime's last remaining military base in Reqqa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has tabulated casualties in the country's civil war, reported on Islamic State's seizure of the military base in late May. While fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza has gotten far more attention in recent days, the death toll in Syria has been higher. Between July 16 and July 25, 1,600 people were killed, the observatory said. And the bloodshed has continued at that pace. On Sunday, 180 people were killed, the group said. The observatory counts more than 115,000 people killed since the beginning of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in March 2011.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Videos show severed heads on poles .\\nThe videos are purportedly of Islamic State having killed Syrian soldiers .\\nIn 10 days, 1,600 people have died in Syria, a human rights group says .\\nMore than 115,000 have died in the conflict, the group says .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Fiona Macrae . Lifesaver: Koalas lower their body temperature by clinging to trees . The image of a koala hugging a tree is as Australian as a barbecue with a few tinnies. That cute pose, however, turns out to play a vital role in the marsupial’s survival. By wrapping their bodies round cool tree trunks, the animals can stop themselves overheating during long, hot summers. Researchers at Melbourne University used radio collars to track koalas’ movements and thermal imaging to measure the trunk temperature of the trees they chose to sit in. During the summer, they sat lower in trees, where it was cooler, and were more likely to stretch out and hug the trunk. Tree trunk temperatures were up to 9C below air temperature, with the bark of their favourite species particularly cool, the Royal Society journal Biology Letters reports. It is thought this allowed them to transfer heat away from their body, without the danger of dehydration that comes with panting. Researcher Natalie Briscoe said: ‘Access to these trees can save about half the water a koala would need to keep cool on a hot day.’ 'Our results highlight the . important role of tree trunks as above ground ‘heat sinks’, providing . cool microenvironments not only for koalas, but also for all tree . dwelling species.' Co-researcher Andrew Krockenberger said: ‘About a quarter of koalas in one population died during a heat wave in 2009, so understanding the types of factors that can make some populations more resilient is important.’ The team added that other tree-loving animals, including monkeys and leopards, are likely to use a similar strategy. Scroll down for video . Study: Researchers said koalas can survive with much less water thanks to their tree-hugging strategy . A healthy koala lives up to 16 years. There were once millions in Australia, but they were hunted heavily for their fur in the early 1900s. Last year the Australian government listed koalas in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory as a threatened species, and some are even warning the animal could face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Study from Melbourne University tracked koalas with radio collars .\\nThey found that in the summer the animals were more likely to hug the trees .\\nResearchers found that trunks were on average 9C below air temperature .\\nLets them cool off without panting - which is dangerously dehydrating .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nPeople with high IQ scores aren't just more intelligent - they also process sensory information differently, according to new study. Scientists discovered that the brains of people with high IQ are automatically more selective when it comes to perceiving moving objects, meaning that they are more likely to suppress larger and less relevant background motion. ‘It is not that people with high IQ are simply better at visual perception,’ said Duje Tadin of the University of Rochester. ‘Instead, their visual perception is more discriminating.' Scientists discovered that the brains of people with high IQ are more selective when perceiving objects in motion, meaning that they are more likely to ignore larger and less relevant background motion . 'They excel at seeing small, moving objects but struggle in perceiving large, background-like motions.’ The discovery was made by asking people to watch videos showing moving bars on a computer screen. Their task was to state whether the bars were moving to the left or to the right. That ability to block out distraction helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others . The researchers measured how long the video had to run before the individual could correctly perceive the motion. The results show that individuals with high IQ can pick up on the movement of small objects faster than low-IQ individuals can. 'That wasn't unexpected, Tadin says. The surprise came when tests with larger objects showed just the opposite: individuals with high IQ were slower to see what was right there in front of them. ‘There is something about the brains of high-IQ individuals that prevents them from quickly seeing large, background-like motions,’ Tadin added. In other words, it isn't a conscious strategy but rather something automatic and fundamentally different about the way these people's brains work. The ability to block out distraction is very useful in a world filled with more information than we can possibly take in. It helps to explain what makes some brains more efficient than others. An efficient brain 'has to be picky' Tadin said. The findings were reported in the Cell Press journal Current Biology. An intelligence quotient or IQ is a score derived from a set of standardised tests developed to measure a person's cognitive abilities or ‘intelligence’ in relation to their age group. IQ tests do not measure intelligence the way a ruler measures height , but rather the way a race measures speed. Modern IQ tests produce scores for different areas  - such as language fluency and three-dimensional thinking - with the overall score calculated from subtest scores. The average score, according to the bell curve, is 100. Studies have linked IQ scores to morbidity and mortality and even social status. The average IQ scores for many populations have been rising at an average rate of three points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. It is disputed whether these changes in scores reflect real changes in intellectual abilities.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Experts found that a high IQ brain was better able to block out larger or more irrelevant images when focussing on a small moving object .\\nBut surprisingly, when tested with larger .\\nobjects, people with a high IQ were slower .\\nto see what was right in front of them .\\nScientists say this explains why some brains are more efficient than others .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

All that was missing was a rubber duck for this panda who splashed around in muddy waters during its bath time in an animal reserve. The two-year-old animal was left even dirtier than before when he rolled through branches and leaves before plunging into his bathing pool at the Bifengxia panda reserve in Chengdu, China. The cub, who spends most of its time sleeping or snacking on bamboo, was captured fooling around by a photographer who happened to be volunteering at the centre. The adorable panda certainly wasn't shy of the water when it came to bath time at the enclosure in Chengdu, China . Splashing around: The animal rolled down a hill through branches and leaves before landing in the muddy bathing pool . David Jenkins, 41, was on his lunch break at the reserve when the playful panda emerged to have a wash. 'Most of the time I visited this area of the reserve the pandas were sleeping or feeding but every so often I got lucky and found them going wild. 'I spotted the panda in this set of photos rolling around in a concrete bathing area, he was there for about 30 minutes and every so often he would climb up the nearby and roll down over and over again until he hit the water. 'Unfortunately my lunch break was over all too soon but I could have watched the panda for hours, it was very entertaining to watch. Photographer David Jenkins was on hand to capture the playful panda as he took his lunch break . The animal ended up filthier than it was before his bath, with leaves and branches sticking to his wet coat of fur . The animals spend most of their time on the enclosure sleeping and snacking on bamboo said Mr Jenkins who was volunteering at the centre . The Bifengxia panda reserve is a favourite among travelling animal lovers who can feed the animals and clean out their enclosures . 'The park was not busy that day and these pandas were very far from the main gates, amazingly it was only me who got see it. 'It was definitely enjoying its bath time!' The Bifengxia panda reserve is a favourite among travellers and animal lovers who wish to interact with animals directly.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Adorable two-year-old panda splashes around at bath time .\\nMoment captured by photographer volunteering at the enclosure .\\nThe Bifengxia panda reserve in Chengdu is a favourite of animal lovers .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Chris Pleasance . and Ian Drury . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused the Pope's compromise, saying that there were worse things than war, including 'the extinction of all that one believed in' Pope John Paul II tried to persuade Margaret Thatcher to stop fighting Argentina over the Falkland Islands, newly uncovered documents have revealed. The Vatican urged the Prime Minister to reach an ‘honourable compromise’ with the military junta in Buenos Aires over the future of the remote group of islands in the South Atlantic. But Mrs Thatcher defiantly rejected the peace plea, insisting there could be ‘no compromise between right and wrong’. The Pope asked Mrs Thatcher to 'compromise' with the Argentine government, fearing that defeat for Argentina would topple its right-wing government, allowing the Soviets to seize more power in the region. But a top-secret memo, released after 23 years, shows how the Iron Lady resisted, saying that the Argentines should 'go home and leave the Queen's people'. According to the Sunday Express Mrs Thatcher confessed that the war was a 'terrible evil' but not as terrible as 'the extinction of all that one believed in.' The Pope made the plea through Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, one of his most senior diplomats, who visited the UK ahead of the pontiff's arrival on May 28 1982. The 50-minute meeting took place in secret with no Cabinet ministers present at around 6.40pm. According to the memo, written by Thatcher's private personal secretary Sir Clive Whitmore to Sir Brian Fell, principal private secretary to the foreign secretary, the meeting was almost entirely devoted to the Falklands. Mr Whitmore wrote that the Pope had concerns over 'dangerous consequences' of a 'general' kind. The Holy See worried that toppling the Argentine government would allow the Soviets the opportunity to drive a wedge between the West and Latin America. The plea came just hours after British troops capture Goose Green, marking the first land battle of the war . Instead, John Paul II suggests that an 'honourable' compromise might suit all parties better. Just hours before the visit took place, around 500 British paratroopers from British Falklands Task Force recaptured Goose Green from 1,200 Argentinian soldiers, marking the first land battle of the war. While the victory was a resounding success for the military, it came at a cost of 17 British lives.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"In May 1982, during Falklands War, Pope John Paul II visited Britain .\\nBefore he arrived he sent senior diplomat to speak with Thatcher .\\nAsked for 'compromise', fearing Argentine government would collapse .\\nIf that happened then the Soviets could try and seize power, he warned .\\nThatcher said there was no compromise 'between right and wrong'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nEmployees using their cell phones at work has topped a list of what their bosses consider the biggest productivity killers in the workplace.

Smoking breaks was voted the fifth most popular way in which employees wasted time at work according to their bosses . Behaviors of co-workers, meetings and other factors are also creating obstacles to maximizing performance. ‘While many managers feel their teams perform at a desirable level, they also warn that little distractions can add up to bigger gaps in productivity,’ said CareerBuilder’s Rosemary Haefner. ‘It's important to be organized and designate times to work on different deliverables. Minimize interruptions and save personal communications for your lunch hour or break.

One of the huge 32-foot glass panels that make up the entrance to the iPhone giant's flagship store was reportedly accidently smashed by a city snowblower that threw up a stone. While there was no immediate threat that the glass would shatter completely, the estimated cost to the Californian firm to restore the cube is estimated to be around $450,000. Smash: This image taken on Tuesday night shows the shattered panel of glass at the Apple cube just off Central Park in New York after it was damaged during the snowstorm which hit the city during the day . 'It's kind of ironic,' quipped Marvin Washington, 53, of Midtown as he passed by to DNAinfo.com . 'Everyone drops their phones and the screens break. Now, it's happened to them.' Other passersby who navigated the Central Park location which was hit by 11 inches on Tuesday said that in fact, the cube would look quite interesting if the entire structure had the same shattered effect. 'It looks kind of cool,' said Griffin Stewart, 30, a web designer from Williamsburg. 'If they did the rest of the cube like that, it would look pretty neat.' Damage: It is estimated that the cost to repair the panel which shattered on Tuesday night will be $450,000 . Interesting effect: The panel is one of 15 at the iconic Apple cube and was installed in 2011 after a $6.7 million renovation of the structure . Others seemed to put their faith in Apple's famed design and said that even though the glass looked precarious, they trusted it was safe. 'I should not, but I do feel very comfortable,' said Guy Levi, 33, to the New York Post. 'It’s nice because there is a view and natural light. It’s like sitting outside but it’s not cold.' Damage: This screen grab from Good Morning America reveals the panel is completely shattered - and will cost the California firm up to half-a-million dollars to replace . Iconic: The flagship Apple Store, known as 'The Cube\", at night - on Tuesday, January 21 the structure had one of its 15 panels damaged by a snowblower .

Kimberly Dawn Trenor is scheduled to go on trial for murder next week in the death of her daughter. But Kimberly Dawn Trenor, 20, pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge, her lawyer said Wednesday. Trenor and her husband, Royce Clyde Zeigler II, 25, both were charged with tampering with evidence and capital murder in the case of Riley Ann Sawyer, whose body was found in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay, Texas, in October 2007. The charge of tampering with evidence accused the couple of concealing the child's remains. Trenor was arraigned Tuesday in Galveston, Texas, said her lawyer, Tom Stickler. Jury selection for her trial on the capital murder charge begins Wednesday. The trial will begin in earnest on January 27, he said. The jury also will sentence Trenor on the evidence tampering charge, which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison, The Houston Chronicle reported. Zeigler, who is being tried separately, has not been formally arraigned, Stickler said. Both remain in jail. The Houston Chronicle reported bail had been set at $850,000 each. Riley Ann's case garnered national headlines after a fisherman found her body on the island in the bay. Authorities were unsure of her identity, and police dubbed her \"Baby Grace.\" Police distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide, and Sheryl Sawyers, the girl's paternal grandmother, contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter. DNA testing confirmed the child's identity. According to an affidavit, Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held underwater before she died on July 24, 2007. She said the couple hid the girl's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay. A medical examiner said Riley's skull was fractured in three places, injuries that would have been fatal. A cross has since been erected on the island where the child was found, which was named Riley's Island in her honor, the Houston Chronicle reported. Trenor moved to Texas from Ohio with the girl in May 2007 to be with Zeigler, whom Trenor had met on the Internet. While in custody, Trenor gave birth this summer to another child, who is now in the care of relatives, Stickler said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Kimberly Dawn Trenor pleads guilty to tampering with evidence .\\nShe faces capital murder trial in death of child known as 'Baby Grace'\\nChild's body was found in plastic container on island in Galveston Bay .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- At least 51 people have died and at least 21 others are missing after torrential rains and subsequent flooding pummeled the Philippines on Saturday, the government said. Filipino pedestrians in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, brave Tropical Storm Ketsana's floodwaters. Tropical Storm Ketsana spawned the flooding, which caused at least six of the deaths in Manila, the nation's capital. Manila and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the downpour, said Gilberto Teodoro, secretary of national defense and chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. Two of the dead in the capital city were victims of a wall that collapsed, he said. Five thousand people were rescued without boats, and another 3,688 were rescued with boats, he said. Another governmental official reported four injuries. \"My neighborhood rarely gets a bad flooding and I guess this is the worst,\" said CNN iReporter Jv Abellar from Quezon City, Philippines. \"Traversing through the flood is like walking through rapids.\" In all, 41,205 people had sought refuge in 92 evacuation centers, Teodoro said. By 8:30 a.m. Sunday (8:30 p.m. Saturday ET), the torrential rains ended and slight rainfall was reported. Some roads in the capital metropolitan area had reopened, but \"we do not encourage people to travel these roads,\" Teodoro told CNN in a telephone interview. \"They can be a hindrance to efficient relief and rescue operations.\" The federal government began massive relief efforts to aid the local governments, and set up aid centers addressing pressing problems such as sanitation and water purification. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has ordered pay parking lots at malls in Manila to be opened so motorists can leave their cars there without charge, Teodoro said. iReport.com: Share images of Philippines flooding .

Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:57 PM on 21st December 2011 . Research In Motion has turned down takeover overtures from Amazon and other potential buyers because the BlackBerry maker prefers to fix its problems on its own, according to sources. Amazon hired an investment bank this summer to review a potential merger with RIM, but it did not make a formal offer, said one of the sources. It is not clear whether informal discussions between Amazon and RIM ever led to specific price talk, or who else had approached RIM about a takeover. Talks: Amazon considered buying RIM, but made no formal offer, say industry insiders . RIM's board wants co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to focus on trying to turn around the business through the launch of new phones, better use of assets such as BlackBerry Messaging and restructuring, two sources said. They did not want to be identified as the discussions are private. RIM and Amazon declined to comment. At the moment Blackberry is trying to make sure that delays to its new touchscreen phones don’t harm the business. Trouble ahead? Blackberry's new phone (not shown) has been delayed until late 2012, which analysts say could damage profits . The new devices are designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android, but have been delayed until the end of next year. It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company. The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand. The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent. Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute. No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed. Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month. The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook. PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest. PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co in New York, said the company needs to get its new phones out fast. Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year. 'We've experienced a delay,' he said. Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Blackberry's income has fallen 71 per cent .\\nNew 'BB10' smartphones to be delayed until 'late 2012'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nWest Ham have pulled out of a loan deal for 19-year-old AC Milan striker M'Baye Niang.

The Italian, who used to play for Manchester City, was seen ‘slam dunking’ the ball one-handed into the basket. It is not the first time the enigmatic frontman has been seen practising his basketball skills. Last year, Balotelli played with team-mates Mbaye Niang and Stephan El Shaarawy in Miami before their 2-0 victory over LA Galaxy. Buildup: Mario Balotelli gives himself a running start... Slam dunk! And he jumps and slots the ball home with just one hand . He also shot footage of himself ‘slam-dunking’ in April, with the caption ‘Kobe [Bryant} I got this,’ thus comparing himself to the modern-day Los Angeles Lakers legend. Milan embarked on a tour of America again this summer, taking part in the Guinness International Champions Cup, an eight team competition of which Manchester United and Liverpool will contest the final on Monday night in Miami. Balotelli and his team-mates, along with new manager Filippo Inzaghi, endured a disappointing tournament, however, losing all three games against AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos with just a single goal scored to their name.

The Italian, who netted 14 league goals for the Rossoneri last season, will hope the sharp shooting and leverage he showed on the basketball court will help the club to better their eighth-place finish in Serie Aand re-establish themselves in European football.

Fredrik Säker painted his self-portrait, took a photo of it and sent it to the local authorities when the time came to renew his licence. The 29-year-old tricked staff at the Swedish Transport Agency when he sent in the photo of the painting and it was given the official seal of approval. Artist's impression: Fredrik Saker used this self-portrait when it was time for him to renew his driving licence . ‘I purposely chose a bad picture. It . felt more realistic, I don’t know anyone who holds up their drivers . licence and says “look what a nice picture”,’ the artist told newspaper Dagens Nyheter. Mr Säker says he had faith in his stunt, but was pleased when he was able to pick up his new drivers licence. ‘I . thought it would go through, that’s how happy I was with the original . painting. But you never know and I was a bit nervous whilst I waited. 'But at the same time it was a photo and I though it fulfilled all their . criterias.' The guidelines . set up by the Swedish Transport Agency (STA) state that a photograph . used for a drivers licence need to be recent and have a certain level of . likeness to the applicant. After the licence was issued Swedish . newspaper Dagens Nyheter contacted the STA who were stunned to find that . they had been conned. Final result: Mr Saker's driving licence which used a photograph of his self-portrait good enough to fool authorities into thinking it was a picture . Although . they say would ‘definitely not recommend’ the public using photographed . portraits, they said they have no issues with Mr Säker’s licence and . defend the approval saying they had no reason to believe the photo was a . portrait. ‘I can imagine you would be able to spot defects on a larger image. The details are impossible to see on such a small picture, said STA spokesperson Peter Ranki. Mr Säker added: ‘This picture is a milestone. It's a sign that my painting is getting better.'

CIA Director Leon Panetta speaks about the fight against al Qaeda at the Pacific Council on International Policy. Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, \"but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage.\" \"Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,\" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. \"I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,\" he said. But he said he believed al Qaeda leaders had come to view Pakistan's tribal regions as \"neither safe nor a haven.\" Two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare, David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, wrote in The New York Times over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but Pakistani sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700. While U.S. officials dispute that ratio, Kilcullen and Exum wrote, \"Every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new desire for revenge and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased.\" \"The persistence of these attacks on Pakistani territory offends people's deepest sensibilities, alienates them from their government and contributes to Pakistan's instability,\" Kilcullen and Exum said. They compared the tactics to British bombardment of the same region in the 1920s and French airstrikes on Algeria in the 1950s, arguing that the strikes were likely to remind Pakistanis of colonial rule. U.S. forces have been battling al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan since the terrorist network's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Both have taken root across the rugged border in Pakistan, where Pakistani troops are waging an air and ground offensive to crush the Taliban in the Swat Valley, northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Prime Minister Yusuf Reza Gilani said Monday that the offensive will go on \"until peace is established.\" CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"CIA Director Leon Panetta makes rare public acknowledgment of raids .\\nU.S. airstrikes \\\"only game in town\\\" to fight al Qaeda in Pakistan, he says .\\nHe says strikes are very precise and collateral damage is limited .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nGordon Brown, pictured, has 'no plans' to quit Parliament amid rumours he may step down in 2015. He is pictured here attending the Nelson Mandela Memorial Service, at Westminster Abbey in London in March . Former prime minister Gordon Brown 'will remain' an MP amid speculation that he could stand down as early as next year. Since leaving No 10 Mr Brown has combined his job as a constituency MP with acting as the UN special envoy for global education. Reports have suggested that he would stand down from the Commons at the general election in 2015. But Mr Brown's office said the former Labour leader remained an MP and had 'no plans to make any announcement to the contrary'.

Responding to the claim he would leave the Commons next year, the spokesman said: 'So many people have tried to write this story on so many occasions with no facts. 'Mr Brown has just announced he is playing an active role in the referendum for United with Labour. 'He is giving a major speech next Tuesday and will be delivering a series of lectures on Scotland's future, the dates of which will be announced shortly. 'He is, and will remain, Member of Parliament for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and he has no plans to make any announcement to the contrary.' Last year Mr Brown described himself as an 'ex-politician'. Taking part in a panel discussion at an education summit in Qatar, Mr Brown was asked his views 'as a politician', at which point he interjected \"ex-politician\".

Kelly Preston is going to speak on a panel titled \"Grief and Resilience\" in October. Preston, 46, will appear on a panel titled \"Grief and Resilience\" at a conference hosted by California first lady Maria Shriver, according to a conference spokeswoman. Jett, 16, was found unconscious on January 2, while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas' West End. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. The Travolta family has not spoken publicly about the exact cause of Jett's death, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said in January the death certificate listed \"seizure\" as the cause of death. The family has remained out of the public eye since his death, only issuing a few written statements. When his latest movie, \"The Taking of Pelham 123,\" was released last month, John Travolta did not take part in the publicity tour to promote the movie, instead issuing a short statement saying his family needed \"additional time to reconcile our loss.\" Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of former Sen. John Edwards, and actress Susan St. James will also be on the panel, conference spokeswoman Marissa Moss said. Both women have mourned the loss of sons.

Delighted: Carla Hodgson, 40, from Gosfort, Hampshire, was distraught when her pet Snowflake went missing . Police officers spent three days searching for a chicken that fled its pen after being chased by a cat. Snowflake, an 18-month-old Bantam hen, had last been seen by neighbours running for its life around the family garden in Gosport, Hampshire. When Carla Hodgson, 40, arrived home there was no trace of her, and she made a desperate call to the police. At first, officers at Hampshire Constabulary thought it was a prank. But eventually, they conceded, and deployed a team to trace the family pet. Ms Hodgson, from Gosport, Hampshire, said: 'When I realised she was missing, I phoned the police and they thought it was a prank call at first. 'They must have thought: 'Is this lady for real?' but I then told I was. 'They then sent some officers round who helped me with the search.' Neighbours joined in the hunt for . the Bantam chicken, which lives with Ms Hodgson, her three sons and two . Staffordshire bull terriers in Gosport, Hampshire. Eventually, 72 hours later, they found her in the care of some children who had seen her sitting on top of a car. Bantams can fly a short distance if they . are startled, and after her escapade with the cat, Snowflake had flown over the wall and onto the nearest roof for safety. Ms Hodgson was delighted. She said: 'It was all down to community spirit. I sent out posters and knocked on doors, I had people calling me saying they had seen her. 'Two or three people told me they had seen her being taken in a house. Desperate to find the Bantam chicken, mother-of-three Ms Hodgson called police to ask for support . 'I went round there and spoke to them. They said they had found her and were not sure what to do and had taken her in. 'We live on such a large, busy road but the sheer volume of people that responded was amazing. 'She's such a pretty little chicken, I'm so relieved to get her back.' She added: 'Snowflake is incredibly domesticated, I've taken care of her since she was a chick. 'If you bring them up from such a young age, they regard you as the mother.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Snowflake, an 18-month-old Bantam hen, was last seen running for its life .\\nOfficers ran 72-hour hunt in Gosfort, Hampshire, with neighbours' help .\\nFound chicken in care of children who saw her on roof of a car .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nGermany and Brussels are locked in a legal battle over benefits for migrants. EU mandarins have backed the case of a Romanian who was refused some payments because she had not been in the country long and was not seeking work. But German politicians say this encourages benefit tourism and risks turning their country into a ‘self-service store’ for migrants. Romanian immigrants gather on the streets of Duisburg. Leaked comments made by the EU commission to the European Court suggest Germany will be ordered to make it easier for migrants to claim benefits . When the 24-year-old Romanian – . identified only as Elizabeta D – arrived in 2010 she successfully . applied for child benefit for her son and for a single-parent grant. But . her application for ‘Hartz IV’ payments, which are targeted at the very . poor, was turned down because she was not trying to find a job. The . case went to a domestic court and was referred to the European Court of . Justice in Luxembourg. Leaked submissions from the Commission to the . court show it believes it is too difficult for immigrants to claim the . benefits – making a breach of EU law. Pressure: The revelations have sparked a furious outcry from one of Chancellor Merkel's most important coalition partners . The case, which is pending, has caused major ructions in the ruling coalition headed by Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. Their . coalition partners, the CSU, have accused the commission of ‘Eurocratic . madness’. It has called for a freeze on all  benefits for newcomers. Andreas . Scheuer, general secretary of the CSU, said: ‘The national social . security systems are not a self-service store for all those Europeans . who come to us. ‘It is shocking for me to see the EU Commission . torpedoing the national protection systems in this manner. If officials . want to intervene from their deluxe offices on our national social . security systems  then there will be bitter resistance from the CSU.’ Markus Ferber, a CSU MEP, said: ‘The national social security systems are and remain the responsibility of the nation states.’ The . case echoes political rows in the UK, which is also facing a series of . legal challenges from the EU over payments to migrants. A spokesman for the EU  Commission said its submissions had been misunderstood. ‘Insinuations . and accusations that the EU Commission urges Germany to pay social . security benefits to all unemployed citizens in the country are . completely wrong,’ she added. ‘There are strict safeguards in EU law to prevent so-called social tourism.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Woman already getting child benefit and single parent .\\nmaintenance grant .\\nShe wanted additional 'Hartz IV'\\nbenefits intended for the neediest people .\\nComments made by commission to European Court surface in the press .\\nThey suggest Germany's stance 'is incompatible with European law'\\nRevelations spark fury among country's powerful Christian Social Union .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nDavid Beckham may have retired from playing last year but there has been no let-up in his god-like physique, as he demonstrates in his latest photo-shoot for his new clothing range.

Italian football fans show their passion for the game. This protracted storyline and the subsequent fallout from it saw readership boom on the SerieATalk.com blog -- our blog of the month. Set up by Christopher Harris in 2007, the blog has become a full-time job for the 39-year-old American. Harris told CNN that he has a strong interest in the Italian football scene, and with a background working in web design and marketing, that motivated him to set up his own site. \"I created it a couple of years ago -- really with the rise in popularity of Serie A. It has continued to grow, and this year the Beckham story was a large factor in that.\" Harris said the rise of Italian football has helped his U.S. based blog flourish since he created it. Read the Serie A Talk blog . Rebounding from the lows of the match-fixing scandal in 2006 -- a World Cup win for the Azzurri and the arrival of top players like Kaka and Ronaldinho has seen Italy's Serie A competition once again become a force in world football. Even today there's no shortage of issues to talk about. With Inter Milan currently storming to the Serie A title, the ongoing David Beckham road-show, and the failure of the Italian clubs in the Champions League -- there's been plenty to discuss and debate on the SerieAtalk blog. Harris said there is plenty of television access to Italian football matches in the U.S. and therefore there was already a base of interest on that side of the Atlantic before he began the blog. The major goal of the blog is to present a unique perspective on some of the issues affecting the Italian game, he said. \"It's a collaboration between several writers around the world. From time to time I write ... but mainly I manage the site. \"Some of our work is talking about the media coverage of the league and looking at the big issues in a unique way,\" Harris said. He said he tried to present the blog in an objective way, rather than supporting a particular club. \"I try to remain neutral and be more of an observer of the league itself.\" Harris also manages a similar blog on the English Premier League -- epltalk.com.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"SerieAtalk.com was set up in 2007 due to the rising popularity of Serie A .\\nThe blog's creator, Christopher Harris, says he tries to be neutral .\\nHarris tells CNN the David Beckham story has brought a surge in readers .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles has converted his 38-year-old Aston Martin to run on biofuel made from surplus wine, his office revealed Tuesday. Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on a visit to a whiskey distillery in Northern Ireland last month. The car was a 21st birthday present from Queen Elizabeth, and the prince has converted it to run on 100 percent bioethanol as a way to reduce his carbon emissions, his office, Clarence House, said. The prince has also converted his other cars -- several Jaguars, an Audi and a Range Rover -- to run on 100 percent biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil, his office added. Details of the prince's biofuel use were made public Monday in his household's 2008 Annual Review, which details the prince's income and activities over the past year. The report says Charles and his household reduced their carbon footprint by 18 percent last year after switching to green electricity supplies and reducing their travel-related emissions. Charles, 59, has a strong interest in environmental issues and rural affairs. He is active in environmental charities, and his food company, Duchy Originals, uses ingredients produced at his organic farm in Cornwall, southwestern England. The biofuels are converted and provided by Green Fuels Limited, a British company that previously provided biodiesel to power the royal train, Clarence House said. The wine used for the bioethanol comes from current vintage that remains after English wine producers reach the EU limit for annual wine production, a spokesman for Green Fuels said. The prince uses wine from a vineyard close to his Highgrove Estate, the spokesman said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Prince Charles' office reveals his car runs on biofuel made from surplus wine .\\nPrince converted other cars to run on biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil .\\nReport says prince's household cut carbon footprint by 18 percent last year .\\nThe prince renown for strong interest in environmental issues and rural affairs .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nHe might have some of the quickest feet on a football pitch, but it was Neymar's speed of thought that was put to the test when he spent the day as co-driver in the passenger seat of a rally car.

Pat McCrory, who is expected to sign it. The bill was passed by North Carolina's House of Representatives this month. The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The bill would also allow North Carolina's health department to make temporary new rules for the state's 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit. It prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, from paying for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life. \"The recent House version allows the medical professionals at the Department of Health and Human Services to write the rules which will ensure women's safety. I want to thank those who worked on an improved bill which will better protect women while not further limiting access,\" McCrory said after the House bill passed. Planned Parenthood called on the governor to veto the legislation. The group said more than 35,000 people signed a petition urging him to do just that. \"Make no mistake: These dangerous and deeply unpopular restrictions would endanger women's health and safety. Governor McCrory should keep the promise he made to North Carolina women during his campaign and veto the bill sent to him today by the legislature,\" Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"This bill would take women back 40 years, and we won't go back,\" she said.

Ice Cream Sandwich is believed to combine previous the smartphone and tablet operating systems Gingerbread and Honeycomb, into a single operating system. It is rumoured to offer a raft of innovative new features including a lockscreen system using facial recognition, more multitasking and resizable widgets. The firms, Apple and Samsung in particular, are bitter rivals in the smartphone and tablet PC sector. While the iPhone remains the most popular single smartphone handset, sales of phones running the Android platform have outsold it by more than twice the amount globally.

Neither club is in the Champions League or Europa League this season and they are exploring the options of playing each other in a lucrative one-off game, almost certainly in the Middle East. United boss Louis van Gaal's plans for his team had been a potential sticking point but he confirmed earlier this month that he backed the idea of meeting top-class opposition in midweek. Neither Manchester United or AC MIilan are in the Champions League or Europa League this season . Louis van Gaal confirmed earlier this month he backed the idea of playing top opposition . AC Milan's director Umberto Gandini confirmed a friendly with United was on the agenda. Gandini said: 'This is something we have been talking about for a few weeks and we have a committed interest to do something together. 'It's just a question to find the right date and then to find the right place.' One possible date would be around Wednesday January 28, which does not clash with any European matches nor any Italian Cup games. There are Capital One Cup semi-finals taking place but that would not impact on United playing a friendly. Wayne Rooney scores as United beat Milan 4-0 in the Champions League round of 16 in 2010 . In 2008 a full-strength United squad played a testimonial game in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in front of sell-out 69,000 crowd on a Monday night and then had a spell at a warm-weather training camp before returning for an FA Cup match. Van Gaal said earlier this month that he wanted his team to play top teams in midweek and had spoken about it to United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold. Van Gaal said: 'I like to play midweek games against high-level opponents.' Both United and Milan could expect to earn more than £1million from the match.

Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 06:59 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:54 EST, 5 February 2013 . A fizzy drink addict who sank a staggering eight litres of cola a day has lost all his teeth - and he's only in his twenties. Australian hotel hospitality worker William Kennewell ignored repeated warnings from dentists that his fondness for soft drinks would rot his teeth and has now been left with a full set of dentures at the age of 25. Mr Kennewell's addiction to the sugary drink even left him with blood poisoning. Addict: William Kennewell has lost all his teeth at the age of 25 because of an addiction to drinking cola . He said: ‘I drank between six and eight litres of soft drink, mostly cola, every day. ‘I’m told a normal person has about 23 teeth, but I only had 13 left and they had to be removed,’ he told The Advertiser newspaper in Adelaide. In fact, most adults will have 28 or 32 teeth, depending on whether they have their wisdom teeth, making Mr Kennewell’s initial teeth loss even worse. Mr Kennewell, who lives in Salisbury, 15 miles north of Adelaide, added: ‘It started because I wasn’t a huge water fan and working in the hotel industry, I had easy access to Coke. Replacement teeth: Mr Kennewell has had a full set of dentures fitted to replace his teeth which have rotted because of the amount of cola he consumed each day . ‘Because my teeth were decaying so badly, it caused blood poisoning which just made me sick – but my health improved with the dentures.’ Australian health experts are now using Mr Kennewell's addiction as a case study to show why youngsters should avoid fizzy drinks. Dr Jason Armfield, senior research fellow with the Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health has called for health warnings on soft drink labels to include the risks of tooth decay. He has already conducted research among 16,800 Australian children that found 56 per cent of those aged between five and 16 consumed at least one sweet drink – a soft drink or juice – every day. Mr Kennewell agreed that health warnings on soft drinks was a good idea – but he wondered how effective they would be. It is little wonder that Mr Kennewell's teeth rotted, as the average 335ml can of cola contains an astonishing 39g of sugar.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"William Kennewell has had a full set of dentures fitted to replace his teeth .\\nThe Australian drank six to eight litres of cola each day .\\nHis addiction to the sugary drink even left him with blood poisoning .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said authorities Friday took a fourth person into custody in their ongoing investigation into domestic terrorism. The RCMP said its Integrated National Security Enforcement Team executed a search warrant in Ottawa and took one person into custody.  No charges have been filed. Earlier Friday, a Canadian government source close to the investigation said the three men arrested previously \"are not card-carrying members of al Qaeda but they follow in the movement and show common trends.\" RCMP Chief Superintendent Serge Therriault said Thursday the three suspects are Canadian citizens living in Ontario -- Hiva Mohammad Alizadeh, 30, of Ottawa; Misbahuddin Ahmed, 26, of Ottawa; and Khurram Syed Sher, 28, of London. The name of the suspect arrested Friday has not been released. Alizadeh faces three charges: conspiracy, committing an act for a terrorist group and providing or making available property for terrorist purposes. Canadian federal prosecutor David McKercher told CNN the three charges carry maximum sentences ranging from ten years to life in prison. Ahmed has been charged with conspiracy, but he could face more charges, according to his defense attorney.  Ian Carter told CNN he met with Ahmed for half an hour.  Asked how the suspect was feeling, Carter said, \"He is in shock.\" Ahmed is married and has a 7-month-old daughter. Sher also is charged with conspiracy, officials said. The RCMP said the three suspects were arrested under Canada's Anti-Terrorism Act, passed in 2001. Therriault said that a yearlong investigation found that in addition to forming part of a terror cell, the suspects possessed schematics, videos, drawings, instructions, books and electrical components designed specifically for the construction of improvised explosive devices.  He said authorities seized more than 50 circuit boards designed to remotely detonate IEDs. In addition, Therriault said, investigators have grounds to believe Alizadeh is a member of and remains in contact with a terror group with links to the conflict in Afghanistan.  One reason the arrests happened when they did, the investigator said, was to prevent Alizadeh from providing financial support for weapons that would be used against coalition forces and Canadian troops in Afghanistan. The three suspects represent the core of the domestic terror group, Therriault said, but the ongoing investigation could result in more arrests. There are no related arrests in the United States, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said there is no clear link between the Canadian suspects and the United States. Therriault said he could not confirm whether there was a direct link to the United States. A Canadian government source close to the investigation told CNN the United States is not the focus of the investigation. U.S. counterterrorism officials said they consider the arrests an internal Canadian matter.

Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck -- who has been arrested in connection with a police probe into phone hacking -- said he would not talk about illegal eavesdropping because of the arrest. He has not been charged. He appeared at the Leveson Inquiry after the paper's most famous undercover reporter, Mazher Mahmoud, known as the \"fake sheikh\" for the disguise he often adopted to get stories. He described doing stories on prostitution and drug dealing, but insisted repeatedly the tabloid \"never engaged in entrapment.\" He defended his methodology, saying criminals had gone to prison because of his work. \"Exposing criminality gives me great satisfaction,\" said Mahmoud, whose appearance was not televised in order to protect his identity. But he said he had never heard about phone hacking by the News of the World until royal reporter Clive Goodman was arrested for it in 2006. The inquiry was prompted by widespread public outrage this summer at the revelation that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered 13-year-old girl in 2002. Murdoch's son James, the chief executive of the News Corporation subsidiary that published the tabloid, has repeatedly denied knowing about the scale of illegal eavesdropping at his papers. James Murdoch ordered the paper shut down over the scandal. Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis also testified Monday. Like Thurlbeck, he has been arrested and released on bail in a police investigation into phone hacking. He argued that Britain's downmarket tabloids were the \"ones that people out there want to read,\" and far outsold so-called quality papers such as the Guardian and the Times. A former News of the World journalist testified last month that the editors of the tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories. Paul McMullan named Andy Coulson, who went on to become an adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Rebekah Brooks, a Murdoch protege, as editors who were aware of the practice. Coulson resigned as editor of the tabloid in 2007 when Goodman went to prison for hacking the voice mails of Prince William's staff, and he later became Cameron's communications director. Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking, saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff. The Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures since last month, including celebrities such as \"Harry Potter\" author J.K.

Steve Nolan . At just a few days old and on his first adventure outside of his underground burrow home, it's little wonder that this tiny prairie dog pup overindulged on tasty snacks and needed to lie down. Surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables that were almost as big as them, the pup and his siblings weren't shy in tucking in to their lunch while out playing with their mother. Two of the siblings even nibbled on the same lettuce leaf as they enjoyed their healthy meal. Flat out: This cute prairie dog pup needed a lie down after indulging in too much fruit and vegetables while having a break from playing with its mother . Hungry: The little animals aren't shy in tucking into their healthy lunch at Maryland Zoo, Baltimore . Animal loving photographer Jen Lockridge spent more than an hour watching the pups play with their mother at Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Jen, from Annapolis, Maryland, said: 'I was amused to watch the younger pups sitting in the exhibit surrounded by animal chow that was almost bigger than them. 'The prairie dogs are fun to watch as they are very active and clever.' The black-tailed prairie dogs live in family territories called coteries. There's usually one male, around three females and their babies in each group. Adventure: The mischievous creatures were enjoying one of their first forays outside of their underground burrow . Tucking in: Two of the siblings share a piece of food as they enjoy lunch in the Baltimore sun . A typical female gives birth to three or four pups a year. Jen, 40, added: 'As they remain in the exhibit most of the time, going underground at night, the staff weren't aware of the multiple births until the babies started emerging from the holes in the ground. 'They are still not sure exactly how many there were. 'This is the first time I'ver ever seen so many smaller pups at one time.' Photographer Jen was there when the Prairie Dog Town exhibit opened at the zoo back in 2010 and she said that within minutes of moving into their new home the mischievous little animals started climbing and jumping over the walls. Loving: Mother keeps a protective eye on her pubs as she was photographed playing and sharing lunch with her offspring . Posing: This prairie dog pub curiously looks down the lens of the camera while nibbling on the food .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The cute baby rodents shared a meal at Maryland Zoo, Baltimore .\\nOne pup seemed to overindulge in fresh fruit and vegetables .\\nIt was one of the family's first forays outside of their burrow .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAndre Schurrle impressed on his debut for Wolfsburg, claiming two assists in their 3-0 win over Hoffenheim.

While Malaysia is a bastion of Islam, many residents see themselves as both devout to their faith and cosmopolitan in their interests. But as Malaysia becomes more modern in its thinking and culture its state-backed religious authorities are fighting to slow progress by issuing some 1,500-plus rulings. Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in Malaysia in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture . Fatwas are guidelines, but police can enforce them under Malaysia's Sharia laws. To ensure Muslims can keep pace with the rules, an 'e-fatwa' site has been started the Globalpost reports. Yoga -  it's Hindu origins can 'destroy the faith of a Muslim'. Wagyu beef - the cows are occasionally fed beer which is forbidden. Botox - unless medically necessary. Black metal - is said to be powerful enough to 'force a Muslim to forsake their faith'. Valentine's Day - as it has elements of Christianity and 'its practice is mixed with immoral acts'. Halloween - it is too Christian and is also 'associated with the devil'. Coffee - if the beans are defecated by animals before being processed. The issue recently came to a head at a dog-petting festival for Muslims, with the organiser receiving threatening phone calls. Muslims are taught that canines are unclean. Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar, recently wrote that Muslims are 'sick and tired of being told, yet again, of more categories of Muslims and practices to be denounced, hated and declare deviant'. Her women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, has also been targeted. It was issued with a fatwa for pushing 'liberalism'. It had pushed for Muslim women to be able to enter beauty pageants. The group were challenging the ruling. The list of fatwas now includes, Halloween, which is said to be too Christian and black metal because it is 'powerful enough to force a Muslim to forsake his faith'. Botox is banned, but can be used if medically necessary.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Fatwas issued to stop Malaysian Muslims from adopting Western ideals .\\nCritics say residents are 'sick and tired' of being told what to think .\\nSisters of Islam was hit with a fatwa for promoting 'liberalism'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Police in Mexico City have detained three people in the mysterious disappearance of 12 people from a nightclub, the city's attorney general said. And for the first time since the disappearance, Attorney General Rodolfo Rios confirmed there is evidence showing that the people who are missing had indeed been at the club. The names of the detainees -- one woman and two waiters from the Heavens After bar -- were not released. Officials said they are looking at the link between the woman and the waiters, but did not say what charges, if any, they might face. Before Tuesday's announcement, the relatives of the missing people -- one of them only 16 years old -- insisted that they had been kidnapped from the after-hours bar in Mexico City's Zona Rosa entertainment district. But police had said there was no proof that that the 12 had even been there. \"There is evidence that the majority of the youths arrived at Heaven in two vehicles, one private and a taxi, but it is unknown how they left,\" Rios said. Still, he said, there is no evidence that an armed convoy snatched the group, as the families say. The attorney general also upped the number of missing to 12 from 11, saying that another family had come forward. The top prosecutor met with the families of the missing to give them an update. \"We are not interested in who took them, we are not interested in any of that, whether they will be punished, or not punished doesn't interest us,\" said Carlos Ruiz, the father of one of the missing. \"Our interest is that they all return alive.\" Not all of the 12 people said to be involved knew each other, but most of them hail from the Tepito neighborhood, a place known for its rough character. That alone has added spice to an already sensational story, leading to speculation that gangs could be involved. The young people were taken from the Heavens After nightclub on Sunday, May 26, between 10 a.m. and noon, family members say. They were forced into a van and kidnapped, they claim. A center for missing persons in Mexico will distribute photos and information about the missing young people across the country. A mass kidnapping would be a significant development because even through the years of drug cartel violence, the capital was a relatively safe place. Recently, however, there is evidence that infighting between local criminal groups is on the rise. More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry. Authorities don't have data on how many of the disappearances were connected with organized crime.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Three people have been detained in connection with the disappearance of 12 people .\\nPolice have not said why these three were detained .\\nThe 12 young people were allegedly kidnapped from a bar in Mexico City .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The Kings of Leon could perhaps 'Use Somebody' to hit the skins after their drummer's surgery forced the band to delay its March tour of Australia and South Africa. \"The Frontier Touring Company regret to advise that the Kings Of Leon tour has been postponed from March 2011 to November 2011 to allow drummer Nathan Followill to recover from surgery for a torn right labrum and bicep,\" Frontier's website said. \"A new itinerary is currently being secured for November in Australia and will be advised to fans this week.

A spokeswoman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, released a statement saying: \"The Foreign minister announced on the Ministry's Facebook page that the government is concerned about the safety of the citizens. The situation is being given the government's full attention. The families of the abductees have been contacted.\" The couple was kidnapped on June 15 as they were leaving their home in Hadda zone, one of the most secure locations of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. They had gone missing for a week before the authorities were alerted and the Dutch embassy informed. Source: 3 European hostages released in Yemen . A tribal leader involved in the mediation process told CNN that the health situation of the Dutch couple was stable although they are going through depression. \"The kidnappers are asking for a ransom but have yet to announce how much,\" said the tribal leader who asked to remain anonymous due to sensitivity of the matter. The tribal leader said that the government has indirectly asked a number of tribal leaders to be involved in this case and to help in ensuring their safe release, adding \"our priority is the safety of the Dutch couple.\" When contacted by CNN, the Yemeni Interior Ministry would not address who was behind the latest kidnapping. \"It is for the best interest of this case that comments are not given by the ministry. But I would like to assure that we are doing our best,\" a senior official in the minister's office said.

A Finnish couple and a Austrian who were kidnapped by tribesmen last December were released five months later following tribal mediation involving Oman. Last week, activists in Yemen launched an online signature campaign this week to exert some pressure on the Yemeni government to ensure that the disappearance of the Dutch couple is treated with care and caution.

Shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze, floor cleaners and engine oil, campaigners warned last night. It said Boots, Nivea and other manufacturers misled the public. The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature. Nivea was criticised for using an unofficial logo to proclaim its Pure And Natural hand cream as ’95 per cent natural’. However, the ingredients show it . contains methylisothiazolinone, a preservative found in window and floor . cleaners and air fresheners. The association said the chemical could cause cancer and is suspected of causing nerve damage. Boots Botanics – a skin care range which draws on the ‘power of plants’ – was also put under the microscope. Items . singled out included the facial oil, costing £9.99, which is labelled . as 100 per cent organic but was found to contain at least four . non-organic ingredients. US . firm Organix – a beauty company unconnected to the British baby food . manufacturer of the same name – was accused of ‘misleading marketing’. Although the brand name suggests products will be organic, its coconut shampoo does not contain any organic ingredients, and there were concerns that at least one component may cause cancer. Unlike organic food, the labelling of organic beauty products is not covered by law. However, there are voluntary certification schemes run by organisations, including the Soil Association. To qualify, certain chemicals are banned from products and all plant-based ingredients must have been grown organically. Peter Melchett, the Soil Association’s policy director, said the many companies that strive to meet the standards are being undermined by those that take shortcuts and make misleading claims. He added: ‘It is wrong that people are putting chemicals found in antifreeze, paint, oven cleaner and floor cleaner on their skin, when they thought they were buying a product made from only natural or organic ingredients. This must stop.’ The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature . Nivea and Organix did not comment on the claims. Boots said any problems with its Botanics range were related to labelling and not the products themselves. A spokesman added: ‘The Botanics range uses the power of plants extracts with scientific formulations to create effective skin care products. We would like to reassure our customers that the ingredients in the Botanics Organic Facial Oil support a 100 per cent organic claim and Trading Standards approve our process. ‘The ingredient list on the packaging may not make this clear.

The Ponderosa fire, which is in a remote area of Shasta County, California, is just one of 42,750 wildfires that have burned 6,901,035 acres in the United States this year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The fire, ignited by lightning five days ago, was 57% contained by Thursday, allowing some families forced from their homes to return, fire officials said. The Ponderosa fire still threatens 900 homes, forcing those residents to evacuate. Nearly 2,500 people, equipped with 263 firetrucks and 11 helicopters, are involved in the effort to stop the Ponderosa fire. Fires rage on Canary Islands . Shasta is one of three northern California counties for which Gov. Jerry Brown has declared states of emergency because of wildfires this week. The other counties included in the declaration, which makes emergency funding available to fight the blazes, are Plumas and Tehama. In Plumas County, the Chips fire has burned 63,147 acres, most of it in the Plumas National Forest. The 1,146 personnel fighting it have managed to gain 40% containment, according to officials. \"Today's mission is clear: hold, hold, hold,\" Operations Section Chief Rob Laeng told firefighters at their morning briefing Thursday. Wildfires spread in Greece . In Tehama County, the battle is almost over against the Mill fire. It is 95% contained after 1,680 acres burned, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. A fire that has burned nearly 100,000 acres, mostly managed by the U.S. Forestry Service, in northern Idaho is still just 5% contained three weeks after it began, officials said.

His nickname: Prime Evil. After apartheid fell, he was put on trial and sentenced in 1996 to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison. But de Kock showed remorse, meeting with victims' families, some of whom publicly forgave him, and helping the Missing Persons Task Force locate bodies, a fact noted by South African Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha. \"In the interests of nation building and reconciliation,\" Masutha said Friday, he was granting parole to de Kock. De Kock was a police officer who ran the C10 counterinsurgency unit, designed to battle the foes of apartheid, including members of the African National Congress. He operated from Vlakplaas, a farm outside Pretoria. When apartheid fell and the ANC gained control of the government, de Kock cooperated with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 1994 to achieve full disclosure of apartheid-era misdeeds. De Kock was convicted of murders, such as the deaths of five unarmed people in a van in 1992, and many other crimes. He was sentenced in 1996 after an 18-month trial. South Africa doesn't have the death penalty. In asking for a mitigated sentence, de Kock said the unit he commanded \"was established with the full knowledge and approval of senior government officials and police generals,\" according to the ANC's webpage.

Moreover, only five per cent of young people would be confident unblocking a sink, while only six per cent said they would be happy to bleed a radiator. Where does this wire go? Just 8 per cent of young people in the UK are confident enough to rewire a plug . An inept 17 per cent said they wouldn't even be confident hanging a picture, with only 12 per cent vowing themselves capable of using a power drill. Just four per cent said they could put up wallpaper, and more than a fifth (21 per cent), doubted their own ability to assemble flat-pack furniture. A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the survey, said: 'In the past electrical goods came without a plug attached so it was necessary to know how to wire one. 'Now though our toasters and TVs come with the plugs already fitted so it seems wiring one is becoming something of a lost skill. 'The Easter weekend is traditionally a time to tackle DIY tasks but it seems young people are content to sit back and let Dad take the strain. Let’s hope future generations don’t lose the skills their fathers and grandfathers took for granted.' Left a bit...: An inept 17 per cenr said they wouldn't even be confident in hanging up a picture up . One man said: 'I still have to ring up my Dad for DIY help. I can just about manage to put a bookshelf together' (picture posed by model) One young man who took part in the survey said: 'I still have to ring up my Dad for DIY help. I can just about manage to put a bookshelf together, but for anything more complicated I need his help. 'It’s not the end of the world that I’m unable to do certain DIY tasks, I mean, if it weren’t for people like me there’d be no work for plumbers and electricians.' A woman who took part commented: 'It’s very unattractive in a man not to be able to do simple jobs round the house. Although I have to admit if there is a DIY task I can’t do my first response is to reach for the internet.' Pretty as a picture: While only 12 per cent can use a power drill, women say they find men not able to do simple DIY unattractive .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Over 90% of 18-25-year-olds cannot change a plug with confidence .\\nOne fifth can't hang a picture, and only 5% would unblock a sink .\\nWomen say it's 'very unattractive for a man not to be able to do simple jobs'\\nMale participants say they ring parents for DIY help, women look online .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- South African golfer Branden Grace claimed the first European Tour success of his career on Sunday after holding off Jamie Elson by one shot to win the Joburg Open. The 23-year-old Grace, who came through qualifying school last year to secure his tour card, posted a level par 72 for a 72-hole total of 270 (-18). And that proved just enough to keep Elson at bay, after the Englishman replicated his opening round 63 to come agonizingly close to ending his European Tour drought. New heart gives golfer new hope . It was a solid, if unspectacular, display from Grace, who held a three-stroke lead overnight. In the end, a round consisting of 16 pars, with just one birdie and one bogey, proved enough for the Pretoria player, despite Elson's valiant effort to snatch victory. \"It's a dream come true,\" Grace told the European Tour website. \"It's nice to win in front of a home crowd and I wouldn't exchange it for anything else. \"It was pretty tough out there today, I played really nicely and I hit the ball superbly. But my putter was cold -- I just couldn't get the speed of the greens -- and fortunately it was still enough to win.\" Six players shared third place, with Scotland's David Drysdale (67) carding the best round of that group. Former U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen carded a disappointing one-over 73 to finish seven shots off the winner.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Branden Grace cards a final-round par 72 to win Joburg Open by one stroke .\\nSouth African finishes on 18 under par to claim his first European Tour win .\\nEngland's Jamie Elson fires a nine-under-par 63 to finish in second place .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThis is the shocking moment a Russian schoolgirl was beaten up and forced to drink from a puddle by classmates who were 'jealous of her good looks'.

Mandy Appleyard . PUBLISHED: . 17:17 EST, 12 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:17 EST, 12 January 2014 . Mandy, 53, gives an honest but life-affirming account of the change of life. This week, she sets out to master her cravings for sweet food. We are what we eat, so they say, and so I am eight parts chocolate and two parts Mini Cheddars. I have to confess my appetite and sugar cravings have been hard to control since the menopause, so I jumped at the chance to meet Dr Marilyn Glenville, a leading expert in nutritional health for women. New Year's resolution: Mandy is ignoring her sugar cravings and adopting healthier habits . Our meeting has galvanised me to adopt healthier habits. This will be the year of miso, chickpeas, lentils, beans, seeds, oily fish, berries, nuts, fruit and veg - all key foods, Dr Glenville says, at this stage of life. I'll also drink eight glasses of filtered water a day and take supplements including vitamins B, C and omega-3 fish oils. My body will become a temple, and cease to be a skip. I'll never bring myself to eat soy or tofu (menopause-friendly foods), but I am set on giving up chocolate, crisps, cake, ready-meals, caffeine, sugar in drinks and Diet Coke. Dr Glenville says middle-aged women also need exercise, seven to eight hours' sleep a night, stress control, some exposure to sunshine (for vitamin D to absorb calcium and aid bone growth) and to bring blood sugar under control by eating well. She is reassuringly positive about the menopause, seeing it not as a medical condition, but a natural transition that moves women into a new stage of life. She also reveals heartening news that we burn more than 50,000 calories a year doing household chores, equal to 57 hours of running. For women like me who don't like the gym but do enjoy housework, this is music to my ears. So many things during the menopause are outside our control, so it makes sense to act wisely when it comes to those we can control - such as what we eat and drink. Here's to that. Here's to this year being the best yet.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Mandy has a sweet tooth which has got even stronger since the change .\\nIn 2014 she is adopting healthier eating habits .\\nThis is the year of miso, chickpeas, lentils, beans and veg (if not tofu!)\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nGus Poyet will make changes to the team thrashed 8-0 at Southampton when Arsenal visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

I’m not a great fan of looking at so many negative things, but this was an exception. ‘It was very quiet, as quiet as I remember. It wasn’t easy for anyone.

It left Leonardo's men eight points adrift of city rivals AC Milan, who romped to a 4-0 home win over Parma 24 hours earlier, but they still  have a game in hand. Alessandro Matri scored the winner for improving Juve in Turin after 30 minutes to improve their chances of claiming a Champions League spot. Frederik Sorensen's cross was missed by Ivan Cordoba and Matri headed home from close in. It was only the second defeat for Inter under their new Brazilian coach who replaced Rafael Benitez and they offered little as an attacking threat. The best chance came eight minutes from the end as Samuel Eto'o played a one-two with Wesley Sneijder but Gianluigi Buffon came out sharply to block the Cameroon star's effort. Earlier, Lazio maintained their title bid with a 2-0 win at Brescia to stay third, seven points adrift. Goals from Alvaro Gonzalez after 18 minutes and Libor Kozak just before the hour mark secured three vital points for the capital side. Coach Edy Reja asked the fans to be patient after his side have slipped in recent weeks. \"We were top and then second and then we lost a few places but there are times throughout a long season in which it's normal to have a bad spell,\" he told AFP. Udinese also kept up their pursuit of a European place with a 3-0 win at struggling Cesena. Antonio Di Natale scored a double allied to a strike by Gokhan Inler as they stay fifth. But Palermo saw their hopes nosedive with a shock 4-2 defeat at home to Fiorentina.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Juventus beat Italian champions Inter Milan 1-0 in Serie A clash .\\nAlessandro Mati heads winning goal on the half hour mark .\\nLazio stay third after a 2-0 win at Brescia but seven points behind leaders AC Milan .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever: the body of Bigfoot. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, a pair of Bigfoot-hunting hobbyists from north Georgia, say they found the creature's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive. The carcass of the furry half-man, half-ape is 7 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds, they say. However, the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures. Tom Nelson, chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, said he's \"pretty skeptical\" the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday. \"That would certainly rock mammalogy,\" joked Nelson, who specializes in the study of mammals. \"I see a research grant in my future.\" Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto, California, in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc. A photograph on that group's Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large, hairy creature with an ape-like face, stuffed into a large freezer. According to a written release, the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show, \"Squatch Detective,\" several weeks ago. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? \"The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was 'the Real Bigfoot Hunter,' Tom Biscardi,\" Dyer said, referring to Searching for Bigfoot's CEO, who has been looking for the elusive, legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971. Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit. Dyer is a former prison guard. DNA tests on the body have begun, said the statement, and \"extensive scientific studies\" will be done on the body by scientists, including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist and a paleontologist. Nelson, the university professor, acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that, in science, \"we always acknowledge the possibility of something new.\" But he said that even in north Georgia, home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail, it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7-foot-tall creatures could have eluded hunters, hikers and creeping development until now. \"To the average person, these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you'll find lions and tigers and bears,\" he said. \"The reality is that you're never more than a mile from a road.\" The group says the animal is male, has reddish hair and \"blackish-gray\" eyes and human-like feet, hands and teeth.

The shooter had just wounded three people Thursday, one of whom died. He was reloading his shotgun when Meis, a volunteer security guard, saw an opening. He doused the gunman with the spray and tackled him to the ground. Other students at Seattle Pacific University piled on and took the weapon away from suspected shooter Aaron Ybarra, 26, police said. Officers are convinced the bloodshed at the Christian school would have been worse had Meis and the others not intervened. A man who said he was close friends with Meis' older brother and sister-and-law described him as \"amazingly resourceful.\" \"I wasn't surprised to see he was the hero -- his resourcefulness, love for others and knowledge of the greater good are what defines him, in my mind,\" Andrew Van Ness told CNN in an e-mail. Van Ness said Meis enjoyed playing a campus \"humans versus zombies\" game organized by the school's Student Union Board, finishing in the top 10 both times the game was held. On Thursday, Meis appeared shaken, at moments on the verge of tears, when ambulances arrived to tend to the wounded. Medics put him on a stretcher and took him to a hospital to check him over. Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg didn't identify Meis by name but said a man believed to be the student hero was thoroughly evaluated and released. He had no injuries, she said. Police would not give out his name, but one of his friends was quick to point him out to CNN affiliate KOMO and pour out his gratitude. \"I could have been one of these people that was injured or in critical condition,\" said Meis' friend Patrick Maguire. \"A lot of (students) were in that building, and he stopped him in the lobby. He didn't get any farther than that. I'm grateful for him, yeah.\" Meis, an engineering student, has a reputation for keeping a low profile, not seeking attention, The Seattle Times reported. He is known as a devout Christian and an excellent student. Meis' sister told the newspaper that the family wasn't commenting for the moment. But he hasn't been able to dodge the social media limelight, which has plastered his name and photos across the Internet with emphatic kudos. \"Hero\" was the common refrain. \"Jon Meis is a hero. I have no words for his courage,\" user Molli Elizabeth posted to Twitter. \"Jon Meis, You are my hero! Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. (Jn 15:13),\" Tweeter Shane Bengry posted with reference to a Bible verse. His longtime roommate Ryan Salgado told The Seattle Times about the pepper spray. He said Meis regularly carries it, just in case.

But now the selfie has been put to good use – celebrities are posting pictures of themselves to campaign against oil exploration off the coast of Ibiza, the Mediterranean playground for the rich and famous. Bearing home-made banners with the slogan ‘Ibiza Says No’, stars including Kate Moss, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and DJ Fatboy Slim and his wife Zoe Ball have posted selfies on the internet and signed a petition lobbying the Spanish government not to lease territory to oil giant Cairn Energy. Campaign: Kate Moss, Charlotte Tilbury and an unknown friend hold up a home-made banner bearing the slogan 'Ibiza says no!' in a picture posted to the internet as part of a push to stop oil drilling off Ibiza . Not in my backyard: DJ Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, and wife Zoe Ball show their support for the campaign . Protest: The singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, whose tracks are iconic in the Ibiza club scene, and model Laura Bailey . The petition, which now has 60,000 signatures, will be submitted this week by the Ibiza Preservation Fund, a consortium of businesses and residents. Singer James Blunt, who lives on Ibiza, model Laura Bailey, make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury and designer Alice Temperley are among others who have also posted selfies to show support. Although it is best known as a party destination, Ibiza is a Unesco World Heritage Site. The deep waters around the Balearic island are home to the endangered bluefin tuna, the striped dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale and sperm whales. ‘We were horrified to discover that the Spanish government had quietly passed a law on Christmas Eve granting Cairn Energy rights to prospect for oil just 15 miles off our coast,’ says actress Lisa Bilton, who is helping to lead the campaign through the Twitter hashtag #ibizasaysno. Unesco World Heritage Site: It's not just a party island, the deep waters around Ibiza are home to the endangered bluefin tuna, the striped dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale and sperm whales . Sir Mick Jagger’s daughter Jade, who lives on the island, said: ‘We’ve been ignoring the environment for too long and now it’s time to speak out.’ Strictly Come Dancing star Ms Ellis-Bextor, a regular visitor to Ibiza, added: ‘It’s about having a conscience about the world we live in.’ It is the first time in the history  of the island that the Spanish government has leased its territory to an oil company for prospecting. Environmentalist Ben Goldsmith, a founder of the Ibiza Preservation Fund, said of the campaign: ‘People complain about Nimbyism, but if they’re not going to do it, then  who is?’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Not just a party hotspot, the island is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site .\\nIts waters host bluefin tuna, striped dolphins, two kinds of rare whales .\\nBut Spain has granted prospecting rights to oil giant Cairn Energy .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThis won't fly with patriotic bird watchers. Emus once farmed for their meat, oil and eggs have been left stranded in desperate conditions in India after local demand for the birds plummeted. In a sad state of affairs, the Indian emu industry has collapsed, leaving thousands of Australia's most iconic birds to roam the subcontinental wilderness without homes or purpose. Businessweek reports the local emu population in India has shrunk from 2 million in 2012 to just 800,000 after the market for the flightless avian species took a swan dive. Homeless and flightless: Shelters are being set up across India to care for thousands of emus abandoned after the local industry collapsed . By the end of the year, experts predict only 350,000 emus will remain in India. Many emus are now living in squalid conditions in shelters around India, the less lucky have been destroyed. Farmed for their meat, leather, eggs, and oil, emus became a popular commodity in India around five years ago but the industry never managed to soar to great heights. Hundreds of emu ranches were set up around India but too many birds and not enough room led many farmers to abandon their stock in the wild, Businessweek reports. The report cited ballooning feed costs and smaller returns for emu meat as the main reason behind the shrinking industry.

The suspect, named by the Nice mayor's office as Moussa Coulibaly, 30, attacked a soldier and a comrade who came to his aid on Tuesday as they patrolled near a Jewish community center. They were slightly injured. Intelligence services had detected the suspect's radicalization in the Yvelines area, west of Paris, Cazeneuve said. They informed the General Directorate of Internal Security, or DGSI. The notification meant that when the suspect got on a plane to Turkey last month, an alert was raised, and Turkish authorities expelled him, Cazeneuve said. The DGSI questioned him but was not at that time able to establish any criminal acts in the works or a legal case against him, the minister said. Days later, while the DGSI was still looking into why he was in Nice, Coulibaly allegedly carried out Tuesday's attack. The authorities are conducting searches and have taken people into custody as they seek to pin down the suspect's profile, Cazeneuve said. According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, Coulibaly was from the Paris area, where he was handed prison time and fines between 2006 and 2009 for offenses, including shoplifting, violence and drug abuse. An official in the Turkish prime ministry told CNN on Tuesday that French intelligence was aware of Coulibaly and had alerted Turkish officials when he flew to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from Rome on Thursday. He was put on a flight back to Rome that same day, the source said. The suspect shares the same last name as one of the three terrorists behind last month's deadly attacks in and around Paris. Officials cannot confirm he's related to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed a police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, then took hostages in a kosher grocery in the French capital, a standoff that ended with him and four hostages dead. Coulibaly is a common name for families of Malian descent. The soldiers attacked were among the French military forces who have been out on the streets around sensitive sites following last month's terror attacks that included the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Philippe Pradal, Nice's deputy head of security, told BFMTV that the assailant initially didn't do much harm because the soldier he attacked had on a bulletproof vest. \"After realizing the inefficiency of his stabs ... he tried to hurt him in the face,\" Pradal said. The attacker injured another soldier trying to assist before he was stopped, with help from a passer-by, public transit officers and municipal police.

Clarke has long been groomed as Ponting's successor, having filled in when his captain was unavailable or being rested, but acknowledges that he is not the most popular choice to replace him. \"I don't know the exact reasons why it's there, but it is and I've had it probably my whole career,\" he told the Cricket Australia website.

Fans of the Football League’s bottom club took to social media and online forums to express their displeasure at comments from new manager Ronnie Moore declaring an interest in signing the 25-year-old, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in 2011. Hartlepool MP Iain Wright had been vociferous in his opposition to the move, but he has now welcomed the decision to back down. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ched Evans' video statement regarding his appeal . Striker Ched Evans used to play for Sheffield United but is now searching for a new club . Hartlepool MP Iain Wright had been critical of moves to bring the striker in, and praised the U-turn . ‘I think it would have been a terrible move for the club and I think it would have split the fans,’ he said. ‘There would have been people who stayed away from the club and the sponsors wouldn’t have wanted to be associated with a convicted rapist and would have pulled out, and that could have compromised the survival of the club.’ Hartlepool’s statement, meanwhile, still mentioned the value of Evans as a player. It read: ‘Following media reports relating to the possible signing of Ched Evans the club wishes to make its position clear. ‘Hartlepool United do not intend signing Ched Evans and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be doing so, irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player. Ronnie Moore believes Evans could help Hartlepool United if he were to sign for the club . ‘This story has emerged following an unsubstantiated internet rumour which the manager was asked to comment upon. The manager responded hypothetically to the situation by stating “if it could happen I would want it to happen”.

Six gunmen were killed in the police operation to retake the Ministry of Transport in northeast Baghdad. Police killed four militants, while two of the militants detonated suicide vests, the sources said. Two police officers were killed and seven injured in the attack. The hostages were freed unharmed. Police earlier said that the militants had overrun the Ministry of Human Rights building, adjacent to the Ministry of Transport. Roads were blocked around the Iraqi capital following the attack, and areas leading to Baghdad's fortified Green Zone were closed. Separately, two car bombs exploded Thursday in different areas in the northeast part of the capital, killing four people and injuring 14 others. One hit a popular market area, a police source said. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed in violence, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out at the end of last year to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. More than 140,000 people have been made homeless since the new conflict erupted, according to Iraq's Ministry of Displacement and Migration. The United Nations said last week it was scaling up its humanitarian response to help those displaced by the violence.

Curt Weldon said he is set to meet with Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday in an attempt to persuade Libya's embattled ruler to step down. Weldon will also meet with Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim, the Republican from Pennsylvania said in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. Weldon said that in addition to Gadhafi's resignation, he is proposing a cease-fire on both sides; a withdrawal of government forces from key cities; no further advances by rebel forces; a joint interim government run by Libya's current prime minister and the an opposition leader; unfettered humanitarian access; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include American, Middle Eastern, European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya. As far as the Gadhafi family, Weldon's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son, Saif, to stand in elections. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was once thought of as a leading reformer in the Libyan government, but the 38-year-old has become one of his father's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest. In an opinion piece written for The New York Times, Weldon said, \"I've met (Moammar Gadhafi) enough times to know that it will be very hard to simply bomb him into submission.\" He said he was in Libya at the invitation of Gadhafi and that U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the trip. CNN did not immediately get a response late Tuesday night from the U.S. State Department or the White House about Weldon's trip. In 2004, Weldon led a congressional delegation to Tripoli and met privately with Gadhafi after the Libyan leader renounced terrorism in an effort to establish warmer ties with the West. Weldon said in his opinion piece Wednesday that he traveled in 2004 to support Gadhafi's decision to give up Libya's nuclear weapons program, though neither he nor the White House wanted to support Gadhafi himself. Weldon told CNN in 2004 that he had 14 meetings with \"everyone in the administration\" and toured a nuclear complex. Libya remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle rebel fighters demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-rule. Weldon's proposal also suggests free elections within 12 months overseen by the United Nations, according to reporter Larry Mendte of WPIX-TV who traveled with Weldon to Libya.

Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:25 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 29 September 2013 . Rewarded: Soldiers are to be offered a helping hand onto the property ladder . Soldiers will be offered interest-free loans of up to £25,000 to help them get a foot on the property ladder. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will today unveil the £200million scheme to increase home ownership in the military. While three out of four officers in the armed forces own their own homes, just 36 per cent of other ranks do. In the Army, the number of non-officers who own homes is just 27 per cent. From next April for a three-year initial period, military personnel will be able to borrow the equivalent of half their salary interest free, up to a maximum of £25,000. Repayments will be spread over ten years to ensure they are affordable. Mr Hammond said: ‘Service personnel can struggle to enter the housing market as they move around throughout their career. By giving our troops this extra help they will be more able to set down roots and get on to the property ladder.’ Trouble buying a house is one of the main reasons given for leaving the armed forces. Personnel are often refused loans because of low pay, frequent moves and deployments across the globe. Computer credit checks often automatically rule them out as too risky. A report by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft for the Ministry of Defence found more than a quarter of military personnel had been refused a mortgage, loan or credit card as a result of their career. Barclays bank said on Thursday it will manually review any mortgage application from a serving member of the armed forces rather than leaving it to a computer.

Ofsted inspected 31 hubs and found 22 had made ‘little difference’ it said none could show they were offering value for money . Children are receiving ‘inadequate and meagre’ music classes despite tens of millions of pounds being lavished on improving lessons, according to the schools watchdog. Ofsted said pupils are ‘poorly taught’ with many never introduced to classical music and primary pupils assumed ‘with no good reason’ to be unready to learn musical theory. School leaders were also found to be over-optimistic about the quality of teaching provided by staff.The government is spending £171 million on a three-year programme to raising standards following a damning review of music education in England in 2011. Must improve: The report emphasised the need for schools to drive up the quality of their music provision and to introduce young children to the value of classical music . This is spearheaded by 123 ‘music hubs’ - local authority music services or groups of professional music organisations which organise lessons. Ofsted inspected 31 hubs and found 22 had made ‘little difference’. Music curriculums still lack ‘depth and vigour’, it said, and services overlapped with those already provided by schools. None were able to show how they were providing good value for money. The report said: ‘We must expect greater impact on music education for all pupils in schools.’ Recommendations included Arts Council England, which allocates the funding, to take ‘rapid action’ to improve the situation. The organisation’s chairman is former television executive Sir Peter Bazalgette, who has been blamed for dumbing down television after helping launch programmes including Big Brother and Fame Academy. Excelling: These year 13 pupils benefit from good music lessons at the Mossbourne Academy in Hackney but many are not so lucky . A spokesman said: ‘The report identifies a number of issues regarding the quality of music teaching in schools. ‘We agree schools need to do more to drive up the quality of their music provision and to listen to and take advantage of the expertise which is being made available to them through hubs.’ Michael Cladingbowl, director of schools policy at Ofsted, said: ‘Music is a demanding academic discipline, developed through exciting practical musical activity. ‘However, the vast majority of the schools visited shied away from teaching pupils about fundamental aspects of music as they thought it too difficult. ‘All children, not just the privileged few, should enjoy a good music education. ‘Music hubs were created with this very aim, so it is concerning that the hubs visited for this survey could not show how their work in schools achieves this or how they provide value for money.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The government is spending £171 million .\\non a three-year programme to raising standards following a damning .\\nreview of music education in England in 2011 .\\nThis is spearheaded by 123 ‘music .\\nhubs’ - local authority music services or groups of professional music .\\norganisations which organise lessons .\\nOfsted inspected 31 hubs and found 22 had made ‘little difference’ it said none could show they were offering value for money .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nSeth Meyers' post-\"Saturday Night Live\" career is going rather nicely.

A highly critical report by Human Rights Watch claims refugees are subjected to 'harassment and abuse' on the streets of the northern French port. There are an estimated 2,500 illegal immigrants in Calais all hoping to sneak across the Channel to Britain. Accusation: Migrants in Calais, pictured, are being subjected to 'harassment and abuse' by local police, according to a report by Human Rights Watch . The report by the global organisation said it interviewed eight people who suffered broken bones caused by the police, and another 21 who were sprayed with tear gas. Flare-ups have occurred in recent months between the rising . number of migrants, who try to sneak into cargo trucks passing . into Britain, and security forces. Last September, hundreds of . migrants protested what they said was police violence. In the wake of clashes, French and British authorities . announced heightened security measures, but a shelter pledged by . the French government for 1,500 migrants and asylum seekers to . open by January is not yet fully functional, HRW said. Human Rights Watch said: 'Asylum seekers and migrants living in the poverty in the port city of Calais are victims of harassment and abuse by French police. 'Nineteen people, including two children said that police had abused them at least once, including through beatings. Help: Migrants receive hot food from the association 'La Vie Active' in Calais on January 15, at the site where a new day center for migrants was opened which should be able to accommodate 1,500 migrants a day . 'Eight were left with broken limbs or other visible injuries, which according to them were caused by police in Calais and the surrounding area. 'Twenty-one, including two children, have said that the police sprayed them with tear gas.' Most of the migrants are living without shelter, with no . access to toilets and showers and limited access to running . water. Many rely on meals provided by local volunteer . organizations. Under French law, asylum seekers have the right to be housed . in a state-run facility as they await the processing of their . claim. Human Rights Watch said it had called on the French government to launch an immediate investigation and also provide police with guidance over the use of force. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve accused the group of 'not verifying the allegations of police violence to which it refers'. He added: 'The seriousness of the charges against the public security forces contained in this document should have led the association to approach those in charge of the police with specific facts.' Calais Prefect Denis Robin, who oversees the police force, said many of the injuries suffered by refugees were as a result of fights between rival migrant gangs.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Report by accuse French police of beating migrants in Calais .\\nEight migrants claim they suffered broken bones caused by police .\\nFrance's Interior Minister accused report of 'not verifying allegations'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Officials became suspicious when ‘applicants were travelling significant distances to complete their test at a specific centre’. Yesterday’s report revealed how ‘investigations concluded that the staff at the centre were colluding with applicants in committing fraud’. It went on: ‘As a direct result, the booking system was strengthened to give applicants the option of only five centres where they could take the test, based on a postcode check.’ Migrants were allowed to take the test, administered by Learn Direct on behalf of the Home Office, at any centre they wanted nationwide . The Home Office has now also introduced new checks to make it harder for applicants to cheat – such as verifying their identity using fingerprints. This is intended to prevent people sitting the test on behalf of somebody else who speaks no English. Earlier this year, a Mail investigation revealed how migrants who can speak no English were being secretly waived through a separate ‘secure’ language test in return for just £500.

The Spanish event, formerly known as the Volvo Masters, has been a fixture on the European circuit since the first staging of the tournament in 1988, but Spain is currently in the grip of recession. Tour chief executive George O'Grady expressed his disappointment that the October 18-21 event, won by Spaniard Sergio Garcia in 2011 and which is staged at the Valderrama golf club, has been called off at such late notice. \"We have been long term partners with the Junta for over 25 years,\" O'Grady told the Tour's official website, referring to the region of Andalucia's government. \"In that time we have seen together with many other events, the Volvo Masters staged in Andalucía from 1988-2008, two American Express World Golf Championships, won by Tiger Woods in 1999 and Mike Weir in 2000, and the jewel in the crown, the 1997 Ryder Cup. \"We have worked together to promote the region, and the Junta de Andalucía and the European Tour have enjoyed an exceptionally strong and committed long term partnership.\" Despite the setback, O'Grady hoped the Valderrama tournament could return to the European Tour's calendar in the future. \"We feel the disappointment not only for our members and all committed to broadcasting and reporting this tournament and the region on a global scale, but also for the many visitors, especially from northern Europe, who coincide their vacations with the tournament. \"We will work with the Junta to rectify this situation both now and in the future.\" When Valderrama staged the Ryder Cup in 1997, Seve Ballesteros' European Team beat the U.S. 14 ½ - 13 ½.

On New York's Long Island on Friday, a 53-year-old woman was arraigned on grand larceny charges for allegedly stealing about $60,000 worth of Lego sets and trying to sell them on eBay, the Nassau County Police Department said in a statement. Gloria Haas was arrested Thursday after allegedly stealing 800 sets of the 80-year-old toys from a Long Island storage facility and moving them to a facility in another town, police said. She had intended to sell the toys on eBay, officials said. It was not known whether Haas has an attorney and she was not immediately available for comment Saturday. Authorities are not saying, but alleged thieves could be capitalizing on the enduring popularity of the simple little bricks which generated $1.1 billion in profits last year for the Danish toymaker. \"The Lego Movie,\" which was released in February, made $69 million in its opening weekend and has grossed more than $250 million so far, according to Box Office Mojo. In Phoenix, police arrested four people allegedly involved in an elaborate Lego theft scheme, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. After the arrests, police spent 10 hours Friday loading onto trucks more than $250,000 worth of Lego sets stored in a garage, KPHO reported. At least $40,000 worth of the Legos are believed to have been stolen, CNN Phoenix affiliate KNXV reported. \"It's hard to believe that two or three people could be taking that much product out of the store, and yet they were,\" officer James Holmes told KNXV. A real estate professional, another man and two women were arrested in connection with the scheme, according to KHPO. It was not clear Saturday whether they had attorneys. Police said one man bought expensive Lego sets at a discount from shoplifters and resold them online. Each of the play sets taken were valued at $100 or more, police said. The suspect allegedly recruited accomplices to go to Toys R Us stores to steal Lego sets, KPHO reported. The boxes in which the toys came would be damaged and turned over to the online seller, who would return to the store and buy a new set, the station reported. The online seller later allegedly used the real receipt for the purchase to return the damaged box set. He pocketed the money and sold the stolen Lego sets online to collectors, KPHO reported. The suspects were arrested on charges that include organized retail theft, trafficking in stolen property, fraudulent schemes and illegal control of an enterprise, police said.

An outpouring of condolences have flooded social media for a family of a teenage girl who was killed after she swerved to miss a duck in Adelaide's north. University student Nicki Allwright died after her Mitsubishi sedan hit a tree on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road at Yattalunga on Friday. The horrific accident came just two days before she and her family were planning to jet off on a 10-day holiday to Bali. Ms Allwright - who was studying human movement at the University of South Australia - was eagerly counting down the days to the Indonesian island getaway. 'We've had a countdown going - 100 days, 80 days, 60 days and the last fortnight she was so excited, saying, \"Bali, Bali\" all the time,' the 19-year-old's mother, Marion, told The Advertiser. Mrs Allwright said her daughter was loved by all and shared a special bond with her 21-year-old sister, Sam. 'Nicki just loved her family, as we loved her,' she said. 'She loved being with Sam... they just adored each other. It's just so tragic — everybody just loved her.' Ms Allwright's siblings - 26-year-old Joel and Sam - and boyfriend of three years, George Blackett, have paid tribute to 'beautiful smiley Nicki' by changing their profile pictures to a photo of themselves and the teenager. The touching gesture sparked an outpouring of condolences for the family. Nicki's mother said the 19-year-old (right) shared a special bond with her 21-year-old sister, Sam . 'Your gorgeous little sister [was] a very welcome visitor at our house. Always with a smile on her face - gentle and kind, but gone too soon,' one friend wrote on Facebook. Another wrote: 'We are all in shock and disbelief, beautiful smiley Nicki. Sending you, Sam, your mum, dad and the whole family so much love xx.' Ms Allwright's parents have also called for the speed limit on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road to be lowered to 80km/h from 100km/h. Alan and Marion Allwright said too many young people had done along that stretch of road.

NATO leaders are on a timetable to withdraw all of the alliance's combat troops from Afghanistan in 2014. \"It will be a presence based less on military contributions,\" Monti said. \"It will be a presence based far more on economic cooperation, it will be cooperation on the exploration and use of Afghanistan's important mineral resources and it will be a cooperation, as it already is in this phase, of institution-building to make Afghanistan an ever more solid country.\" Monti met with Karzai after visiting Italian forces on a surprise trip to Herat, Afghanistan, where Italy's troops there are based. About 4,000 Italian troops are stationed in Afghanistan, according to a tally published by NATO's International Security Assistance Force on October 8. At least 49 Italian troops have died in the Afghan war, according to a CNN tally. Sunday is Italy's Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the end of World War I and honors Italian troops.

The Spaniard played 85 minutes of United's 2-0 victory over Cardiff City before being substituted to a standing ovation following a promising debut. \"It was a very special day for me. My first game -- my debut -- with a victory. It was perfect. I enjoyed it a lot,\" Mata told Manchester United's in-house media company MUTV. \"What I love most is to play. So these minutes [on the pitch] are very important. Now I'm going to train and I'm looking forward to playing at the weekend and trying to do my best for the team.\" Signed for a club record $61 million, Mata -- who trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Monday following his move from Chelsea -- had a hand in United's opening goal. It came as he swept a diagonal ball out to Ashley Young, whose cross was eventually turned in by Robin van Persie after Antonio Valencia's header hit the crossbar. The Dutchman had needed just six minutes to score after making his first start since December 10 following a thigh problem. Young doubled the lead in the second half as United ensured that the return of 1999 Champions League winning legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, now in charge of Cardiff, to Old Trafford was not a happy one. United's victory enabled them to close the gap on sixth-placed Everton, who were thumped 4-0 by city rivals Liverpool as Daniel Sturridge (2), Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard gave the home fans a night to remember. The misery for Blues boss Roberto Martinez was compounded when Romelu Lukaku was forced off the field on a stretcher after a worrying injury to his ankle. Dropped Points . Another manager who may be feeling a little unease is Arsene Wenger, whose Arsenal side lost two potentially crucial points at Southampton in a 2-2 draw. The Gunners' coach was held up in traffic ahead of the game and the team also struggled to go through the gears, trailing 1-0 at halftime following a lackluster 45 minutes. Goals from Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla turned the game on its head, but Adam Lallana replied for the hosts to ensure that the match finished 2-2. Arsenal still lead the Premier League but the draw means second-placed Manchester City can climb above them should Manuel Pellegrini's free-scoring side win at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Chelsea can also climb above Arsenal on Wednesday, should Jose Mourinho's side beat West Ham at home by more than two goals. In Tuesday's other games, Swansea and Crystal Palace recorded much-needed wins -- at home to Fulham (2-0) and Hull (1-0) respectively -- while Norwich hosted Newcastle in a goalless encounter that featured a red card apiece for both sides.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Record signing Juan Mata makes Man Utd debut and departs to standing ovation .\\nUnited beat Cardiff City 2-0 as Van Persie marks return from injury with early goal .\\nArsenal stumble at Southampton to allow Man City the chance to go top of the Premier League .\\nLiverpool thrash Everton 4-0 thanks to goals from Sturridge (2), Suarez and Gerrard .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nJames Ward-Prowse has shown his determination to make a swift comeback from injury after hitting the gym... wearing his foot brace.

D.C United, who finished top of the East in the regular season, went close on the hour when a dipping drive from Argentine Fabian Espindola flashed just over the bar. But that was one of the few real chances created by Ben Olsen's team who never got into top gear against a confident New York.

Today, Robbins is in the San Diego County jail, inmate No. 13704837, charged with 12 felony counts of making criminal threats and stalking, authorities said. Robbins, 56, of Oceanside, California, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the charges in San Diego County Superior Court, said District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis. Robbins is facing up to nine years in state prison for stalking his ex-girlfriend and making criminal threats against a La Jolla plastic surgeon, the prosecutor said. San Diego Superior Court Judge David Szumowski set Robbins' bail at $550,000, and he was ordered to have no contact with the two people involved in the case and not to possess a gun, Dumanis said. A readiness hearing for Robbins has been set for February 22 and a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for March 22. When heroes disappoint our kids . Border Patrol agents arrested Robbins late Sunday as he entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman. A computer check of his passport revealed that Robbins, who was driving into the country alone in a 2006 Mercedes, was wanted in San Diego on a felony warrant, Customs spokesman Ralph DeSio said. Robbins acknowledged to police that he is the same Peter Robbins who was the child actor, San Diego Police spokesman Gary Hassen said. The four counts of threatening death and one stalking charge involve four victims, including a San Diego Police sergeant. Robbins allegedly threatened the officer with bodily harm during a January 13 incident, Hassen said. Police in Oceanside and Carlsbad, California, are also investigating incidents there, Hassan said. CNN was unable to contact Robbins or a representative for comment. Robbins was 9 in 1965 when he was cast as Charlie Brown in the animated \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown.\" \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" was produced later that year, using Robbins as the lead voice. Other TV movies using Robbins' voice include \"Charlie Brown's All Stars!\" \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,\" \"You're in Love, Charlie Brown\" and \"He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown.\" His last role as Charlie Brown -- \"It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown\" -- was produced when Robbins was 13. He told an interviewer in 2008 that he was replaced when his voice changed too much after he turned 14. Robbins' on-camera acting career included featured roles in episodes of TV's \"Rawhide,\" \"The Munsters,\" \"F Troop\" and \"Get Smart.\" Robbins' last acting role was in a 1972 episode of \"My Three Sons,\" according to the Internet Movie Database. He grew up to become a California real estate agent, living in Oceanside with his dog, Snoopy, his official biography said.

Yet the real number of severe respiratory illnesses caused by this virus is probably even higher, the CDC says. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in the early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But Enterovirus D68 appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. \"Children less than 5 years old and children with underlying asthma appear to be at greatest risk of having medical complications from EV-D68,\" Oklahoma epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. \"If a child develops a cold or a cough, parents and caregivers should just watch the child a little more closely. ... If wheezing or asthma-like symptoms develop, medical care should be accessed immediately.\" What parents should know . The virus is hard to track, as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. But the CDC has asked hospitals across the country to send in samples if workers suspect that Enterovirus D68 has caused a patient's severe respiratory illness. Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma are the latest to join the growing list of states with confirmed cases, health officials say. Seven of 24 specimens sent to the CDC from Oklahoma hospitals and laboratories have tested positive for Enterovirus D68, the Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Tuesday. The state has seen an increase in pediatric admissions at hospitals in its central region. Enterovirus infections difficult to track . The Alabama Department of Public Health also sent six samples from Mobile County to the CDC for testing; four came back positive for Enterovirus D68. One of the other samples was Coxsackievirus B3, and the remaining one was negative, the department said in a news release. Health care providers in the state have been asked to report clusters of severe respiratory illness. Four children in Lake County, Indiana, were sickened by Enterovirus D68 and were treated at University of Chicago Hospital, according to a news release from the Indiana State Department of Health; all four have since been discharged from the hospital. Lake County is in the northwest corner of the state. Other states including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Utah are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses.

Chelsea's Portuguese midfielder Deco has been strongly linked with a summer transfer to Inter Milan.

Weir suffered an injury to his arm during the league clash with Edinburgh on December 27 and a scan showed the 23-year-old would require surgery to fix the problem. A statement on Glasgow's official website said: 'Following an injury sustained in the game against Edinburgh Rugby at Scotstoun on Saturday 27 December and a subsequent MRI scan at BMI Ross Hall Hospital, it was advised that Duncan Weir required surgery to repair his right biceps. Duncan Weir kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome last season . 'Duncan has successfully undergone surgery and will be out of action for up to four months.' Weir was Scotland's starting fly-half in the 2014 Six Nations championship and kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome. The Glasgow stand-off also played in the Scotland side that defeated Argentina 21-19 in Cordoba last June, kicking 11 points in the victory, before being on the losing side to South Africa. The Glasgow fly-half will miss the 2015 Six Nations Championship after undergoing surgery on a bicep injury . Weir was named in Vern Cotter's squad for last year's autumn internationals, although he lost his starting berth to Glasgow team-mate Finn Russell. Scotland finished fifth in last year's Six Nations tournament thanks to their narrow win over Italy. Glasgow also announced that loose forward Tyrone Holmes will be out for up to six weeks after he underwent a procedure to repair a fractured eye socket suffered in the game against Edinburgh on January 2.

The China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), a state-run department, blamed a \"malfunction in root servers\" that blocked access to top-level domain names in China such as .com and .net, according to a post on its Sina Weibo account, the Twitter-like micro-blogging service. Security analysts quoted by the official Xinhua news agency said this could have been the result of a cyber attack by hackers -- though this has not been proved. Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) confirmed it owns the web address users were redirected to but denied any involvement. It said the company's IP address is already blocked in China so users would have been met by a blank web page. DIT President Bill Xia told CNN Wednesday that the Internet outage was likely caused by China's own web censorship system, more widely known by its infamous \"Great Firewall\" moniker, which controls access to content on the Internet inside China deemed unsuitable. China 'employs 2 million to police internet' \"Their DNS hijacking system is used to redirect visits to certain websites to the wrong IP address,\" he said. \"But this time it was likely a temporary misconfiguration that affected all domain names.\" According to its website, the U.S.-based company provides a range of services including anti-censorship solutions and has worked \"to provide web access to forbidden sites for Internet users in China,\" with the Epoch Times, a newspaper run by the Falun Gong, listed among its clients. The Falun Gong is a spiritual movement that has been banned in China since 1999, accused of \"spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances and jeopardizing social stability.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Access to domain names such as .com blocked Tuesday afternoon in China .\\nState media quoted security experts saying this could have been cyber attack .\\nInternet users rerouted to U.S.-owned website with links to banned group in China .\\nDynamic Internet Technology said problem likely caused by China's own censors .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:47 EST, 17 September 2013 . Mind over metal: Bands such as these are useless to arthritis sufferers, according to a new study . Copper and magnetic bracelets worn to help relieve the crippling pain of arthritis are useless, scientists say. The healing effect that some users report is no different when wearing wrist straps made of any other material, according to the first scientific study into the treatment. Magnetic and copper bracelets are said to help a variety of ailments, including the chronic joint pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders. Manufacturers of the bracelets, which cost between £30 and £50, suggest these conditions can be alleviated by rebalancing the body’s magnetic field or topping up depleted copper levels through the skin. However, the research shows they were no better than a wrist strap that was not magnetic or did not contain copper. Although previous research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the bands, the latest trial, by York University, is the first scientific study of its kind. It studied the use of copper bracelets and magnetic wrist straps for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis. 'Devices such as these provide a placebo effect for users who believe in them,' said Dr Stewart Richmond, a research fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at York, who led the study. 'People normally begin wearing them during a flare-up period, and then, as their symptoms subside naturally over time, they confuse this with a therapeutic effect. 'Pain varies greatly over time in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and the way we perceive pain can be altered significantly by the power of the mind.' Seventy arthritis patients with active symptoms, aged between 33 and 79, each wore four different devices over five months, reporting on their pain and medication use throughout the study, which was published in the science journal Plos One. Placebo: Scientists say that arthritis sufferers often mistakenly think that when pain subsides naturally after a flare-up, it is because of the magnetic bands . They also provided blood samples in order to monitor any changes in inflammation levels. Dr Richmond said: 'People may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions such as dietary fish oils for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness. 'Warning people who suspect they may have rheumatoid arthritis to consult their GP and seek early medical treatment, rather than placing faith in such devices, is also important in helping to avoid long-term joint damage resulting from uncontrolled inflammation.' His report concluded: 'The results of this trial fail to provide any support for belief in the anti-inflammatory effects of magnetic wrist straps and copper bracelets.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"York University scientists tested a range of devices on 70 arthritis sufferers .\\nBut the bands, which can cost up to £50, had no effect on their pain .\\nStudy concludes patients are better off saving their money .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA former nuclear engineer on Tuesday was convicted of murder for poisoning his wife with a lethal dose of nicotine in Southern California in 1994. Jurors in Orange County Superior Court found Paul Curry, 57, guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his then-50-year-old wife, Linda, a district attorney's statement said. Curry killed his wife to collect more than half a million dollars in life insurance and benefits after she died, prosecutors said. He sedated his wife with the sleep drug Ambien before injecting her with nicotine, Ebrahim Baytieh, deputy district attorney for Orange County, said during the trial. Guilty: Paul Marshal Curry reacts beside his attorney Lisa Kopelman, a deputy public defender, as a jury declares him guilty on all counts in a Santa Ana courtroom on Tuesday . Almost got away with murder: It was 20 years before Paul Curry, 57, was found guilty for murdering his wife . Murdered: Linda was murdered by her husband in 1994 who sedated her with ambien and then injected her with a lethal dose of nicotine so he could gain $500,000 in life insurance and benefits . Curry's wife suffered from a series of health issues including anxiety, depression and stomach pain, Curry's lawyer, Lisa Kopelman, has said. A message seeking comment was left for Kopelman on Tuesday. But she insisted on Curry's innocence during trial. 'This case is all about conjecture, innuendo and suspicions, and that is not what guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is,' she said, according to City News Service. Curry and his wife met in 1989 when they worked at the San Onofre nuclear power plant in northern San Diego County. Curry had previously been married, but he left his former wife after she was rejected for life insurance, Baytieh said. Curry was arrested in 2010 in Salina, Kansas, where he had rebuilt his life and worked as a building official. \"For 16 years, he thought he had gotten away with it,\" Baytieh told the Orange County Register, \"and now he's going to prison for the rest of his life.\" Going to jail: Paul Marshal Curry was charged with and convicted of first degree murder and insurance fraud for the 1994 poisoning of his chronically-ill spouse in an attempt to collect life insurance monies .

The oil giant and officials from the South American nation have been feuding since 2007, when Chavez's government nationalized a joint project in the country's crude-rich Orinoco belt. A case before the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is pending. \"I will say it once. We will not recognize any decisions of the ICSID. We will not recognize them,\" Chavez said on state television Sunday. A hearing in the ICSID case is scheduled for the first quarter of 2012, according to a summary of the dispute published in an Exxon financial report. Last week Venezuela's state oil company PdVSA said it would pay ExxonMobil $255 million after the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled that Venezuela owes ExxonMobil $907 million. Past debts and asset seizures make up the difference, officials from PdVSA said in a statement. Chavez criticized ExxonMobil, which has asked for billions of dollars in compensation, for continuing with the case. \"Since they couldn't do it in Paris, now they are going to the ICSID in the United States,\" he said. ExxonMobil affiliates filed the ICSID arbitration case against Venezuela in September 2007 over the Cerro Negro Project, which was a joint venture until the Venezuelan government took over ExxonMobil's 42% interest in June of that year. ExxonMobil has argued that PdVSA breached obligations under an investment treaty. Venezuela argued that taking over the project and others in Orinoco belt was its sovereign right. Chavez, who has nationalized numerous industries and land holdings during his 13-year tenure, said Sunday that he supported Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's proposal to create a new arbitration body \"where we can settle whatever differences there are between governments and companies in Latin America.\" Venezuela -- along with allies Bolivia and Nicaragua -- has said in the past that it would withdraw from the convention that created the ICSID, arguing that the international body gives transnational companies a gateway to violate national sovereignty. Chavez repeated those concerns Sunday, saying the arbitration panel was being used to threaten his country. \"They are trying to achieve the impossible, that we pay them what we are never going to pay,\" he said. World Bank directors devised the international arbitration panel in 1965. More than 140 countries are members, according to a statement on the ICSID website, which describes the body as an \"autonomous international institution.\" CNN''s Catherine E.

Jennifer Newton . A historic hilltop town in Sicily has put 20 empty properties on the market for just one euro each in a bid to attract new investment to the area. Local authorities in Gangi are offering the properties for just 80p as many lie derelict after being bequeathed to locals who cannot afford to renovate them. The only catch is that buyers have to pay a €5,000 (£3,970) guarantee to ensure that they will refurbish the homes, with some estimated at needing around €35,000 (£28,000) worth of improvements. Scroll down for video . The 20 properties, on the market for just one euro, are available in the Sicilian town of Gangi, pictured, which has Mount Etna as its backdrop . They will also have to pay the €6,000 (£4,760) legal costs associated with purchasing the property. The initiative to encourage people to buy the homes was launched a few years ago, but is now starting to receive interest thanks to English speaking property consultant Marie Webster. Ms Webster who lives in Sicily is now marketing the homes to foreigners. She told the Local: 'They want foreigners to come in and take over the properties, because there isn’t much work around here so people are moving away. It’s a beautiful project. Many of the homes up for sale in Gangi lie derelict and it is estimated 35,000 euros worth of repairs would be needed on each one . 'You need to have someone to fix the roof, the floors, the sewage and water. These more difficult things would cost around €35,000, then the rest you can do yourself and have a house that’s completely like new.' It is thought that there has been interest in the properties from British, Swedish and American buyers with some of the homes already being snapped up by an Italian businessman. The town of Gangi is described as being in central Sicily set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields with Mount Etna as its backdrop. The town of Gangi is described as being in central Sicily set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields and is 50 miles south-east of Palermo . The initiative is similar to a plan launched in nearby Salemi, where houses overlooking the Mediterranean were also put up for sale for one euro. Many of the properties there were barely standing, and in dire need of renovation, following a destructive earthquake in 1968.

The 32-year-old mezzo-soprano, who is thought to have met Baroness Thatcher through their charity work for the Armed Forces, sparked outrage on Twitter from users who thought the dress was inappropriate for the stately occasion.

Lashaun Armstrong swam to shore Tuesday night and was picked up by a passer-by and brought to a nearby fire station in Newburgh, New York, said Fire Chief Michael Vatter. Soaking wet and suffering from a mild case of hypothermia, Armstrong then told fire officials his mother had driven the vehicle into the river. Police divers later discovered the bodies of Lashanda Armstrong, 25, an 11-month-old girl, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy some 25 yards off shore. A police investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the water, according to Newburgh Police Chief Michael Ferrara. Responders, using dive teams and a circling helicopter, found the van after an hourlong search submerged in eight feet of murky water, according to Vatter. Before the incident, a relative called police reporting a \"domestic disturbance\" that police say may have involved Armstrong's husband, Jean Pierre. That belief is based on a phone call the relative received in which they said they heard \"tussling in the background,\" noting a history of domestic problems, police said in a statement Wednesday. Police declined to identify the relative. An autopsy on the four bodies is scheduled for Wednesday. Newburgh Mayor Nicholas Valentine said the incident is certain to have \"a lasting effect on this city.\" City resident and neighbor Christine Santos said she \"would never have imagined (Lashanda) to do this to her kids.\" \"To them little babies. I would have never have imagined. I'm in shock,\" she added. Other neighbors described her surviving son, Lashaun, as responsible. \"He was the type of kid that was responsible for his little ones,\" said resident Carmen Davila. But the traumatic effects of Tuesday's incident could have long-term effects on the boy, analysts say. \"He has this major traumatic event and loss and that can be manifested in many ways,\" said Dr. Louis Baptista, director of Columbia University's Clinical Services for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He warned of \"aggressive behavior, through violence, through depression, through depressive symptoms and that can be quite severe and quite impairing in a child his age.\" CNN's Deb Feyerick and Sheila Steffen contributed to this report .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"An 11-month-old girl, 2-year-old boy, 5-year-old boy and their mother died .\\nAn investigation suggests the mother intentionally drove into the Hudson River .\\nA relative had called earlier to report a \\\"domestic disturbance,\\\" police say .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThis is the shocking moment a two-year-old girl and her mother were sent flying on an escalator and ended up with their hands trapped in the mechanism .

'My daughter rolled past that person and then I saw her hand disappear into the side of the mechanism. When I tried to rescue her I got trapped as well.' Stuck: Liu Chao comforts her daughter as rescuers work to free both from an escalator. The pair became trapped after taking a tumble at the shopping centre in China . Bundled over: A mother and her two-year-old daughter both get hands trapped in escalator in China. They fell over after man dropped a suitcase, sending them flying as he tried to grab it . Help at hand: A mother and daughter endure traumatic wait as rescuers work on their trapped hands. The pair were knocked over on an escalator, causing each to get a hand stuck in the mechanism . She said that the mechanism carried on going for several seconds before somebody had managed to press the stop button and raise the alarm, and her screaming daughter had convinced her that the child's hand had been permanently mangled. The man who had caused the accident meanwhile ran off, dashing outside of the store in the city of Zigong in south-western China¿s Sichuan province and climbing onto a bus which then drove off. Back inside, mum Liu said: 'I was terrified and thought that my daughter would be crippled. When the firemen turned up they had to take the escalator apart very carefully in order to make sure they didn't cause any more damage. Store spokesman said the rescue had taken about 45 minutes to free the child's left hand, and the woman's right hand. Free: The two-year-old girl is free after a 45-minute rescue operation. Neither her or mother Liu Chao suffered serious injury to their hands .

New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year. Authorities say a probe by the Office of Weights and Measures found the stations sold the fuel from December 6-8. The stations are located in the towns of North Plainfield, Trenton, Manasquan, Lawrenceville and Scotch Plains. Gas pains: New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year .

Officials say the sales were discovered . after an employee of the terminal where the fuel was being held in .

Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said in a statement to the Star-Ledger that he would seek monetary damages for anyone who could prove that their vehicle had been damaged by the bad fuel. Mr Chiesa said: 'We allege that these gas stations clearly knew, or should have known, they were selling aviation fuel that contains toxic lead, while advertising it as unleaded gasoline for motorists.' The aviation fuel contained toxic lead that could damage the vehicles, but say it doesn't appear any cars were affected.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Gas stations accused of selling aircraft fuel in pumps meant for cars .\\nAviation fuel contains led that can damage a car .\\nSix sued gas stations are located in the New Jersey towns of North Plainfield, Trenton, Manasquan, Lawrenceville and Scotch Plains .\\nLawsuit charges that parent company Zephyr Oil, distributor Pasmel and transporter Lee Transport knew or should have known about the mix-up .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

James Salmon . 'Casino banker': John Hourican, head of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will step down over the Libor rate-rigging scandal . The top ‘casino banker’ at Royal Bank of Scotland is to step down over the Libor  rate-rigging scandal – and will be forced to return up to £7million in bonuses. John Hourican, head of the bank’s investment arm, will quit at the end of the month in an attempt to satisfy demand from politicians and regulators for a senior scalp. Mr Hourican, the state-backed lender’s most highly paid employee, will have to give up £4million in share options he was due to receive from previous years. Sources at the bank indicated that it would dock up to £7million in total, as Mr Hourican will also forfeit his bonus for last year. The figure has not yet been disclosed, but he received a £2.5million payout in 2011. He will still receive a pay-off worth £700,000, however, as he retains his contractual entitlement to a year’s salary. The news emerged as RBS braces itself to receive a fine of around £400million later today for rigging Libor interest rates. That dwarfs the £290million fine issued to Barclays last summer. Damning emails are expected to show that RBS traders bragged about rigging the Libor rate, which is used to set mortgage repayments for millions of customers and is linked to trillions of pounds of investments around the world. Although there is no evidence that Mr Hourican knew about the scandal, traders are understood to have brazenly rigged rates on his watch. The high flyer joined RBS in 1997 and became head of the investment banking arm in October 2008. The manipulation of the Libor rate is . alleged to have occurred between 2006 and 2010. Supporters of Mr . Hourican point out that most of the wrong-doing occurred before he took . the helm. Braces itself: RBS is preparing to receive a fine of around £400million later today for rigging Libor interest rates which is used to set mortgage repayments for millions of customers . Overshadows: The fine for RBS dwarfs the £290million fine issued to Barclays last summer . But he is already a controversial figure at the bank, having presided over thousands of jobs cuts as he wound down the investment arm. Last year Mr Hourican cashed in £4.8million in share bonuses awarded to him in 2009, just months after RBS received a £45billion bailout from taxpayers. And in March 2010 he received a package worth £7.7million, including deferred share awards paid out in later years. In an attempt to appease public anger, George Osborne this week promised that RBS bankers – not taxpayers – would pay the Libor fine out of their bonuses.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Mr Hourican will quit to satisfy demand from politicians and regulators .\\nRBS is bracing itself for a fine of around £400million later today .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

He’s knocked his opponents senseless in the ring but Mike Tyson admitted defeat in a bear-knuckle confrontation with a koala in Brisbane, Australia. The former world heavyweight champion, 46, threw in the towel when he was given the chance of cuddling a koala called Tracy, declaring that she might just put the bite on him. That, he was anxious to make clear, was in no way meant as a reminder of his famous ear-bite of Evander Holyfield. Not sure about this: Mike Tyson weights up the pros and cons of cuddling a koala in Brisbane, Australia . ‘I’ve seen the TV show When Good Animals Turn Bad,’ he said as his excuse for not taking Tracy into his arms, even though he once owned three tigers. Apart from being concerned about those claws, he added: ‘They also carry bacteria.’ So having conceded defeat in the first round of a ‘friendly’ with the koala, he was anxious to make the point that he was in Australia to spread the message that people should try to ignore the bad times. Not a chance! The former boxer wouldn't give the koala a cuddle, for fear of getting scratched or bitten . When good animals turn bad: The legendary world heavyweight champion once owned three tigers . Of his speaking tour of the country, he said: ‘The message of my show would be no matter what adversity hits you in life, don’t give up – that’s the only time you will lose. ‘Some can be a champion and never have a title.’ He even hoped that his former opponent Holyfield would hear his message after learning that the four-time champion was in financial trouble. ‘We all have to endure some kind of pain,’ said ‘Iron Mike’. ‘I like Evander. Evander’s going to be all right. Tyson’s own downward spiral began in 1990 when, after winning his first 37 professional bouts, he was knocked out by Buster Douglas. This one does bite! Tyson bites the ear of Evander Holyfield's during their infamous 1997 fight . Two years later he was jailed for rape and later he admitted to squandering some $300 million. It didn’t get any better when he was embroiled in the ear-biting scandal in the fight with Holyfield. At the age of 39, he retired for good in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same guy – I just grew up a little bit’. Although women’s groups and community leaders are appalled that the Australian government gave him a visa, he said he was now very different to his old title of ‘the baddest man on the planet’.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Former boxer, 46, in Brisbane, Australia for speaking tour .\\nTurned down Tracy saying 'I've seen When Good Animals Turn Bad'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Manti Te'o's Twitter bio reads: \"Life is a storm..

The Irish needed to win by a big margin and then see Les Bleus handsomely defeated by England in the evening match to have a chance of retaining their crown. However, Scotland spoiled any hopes of a tense finale by snatching a 23-20 victory in the last rugby union match to be held at Dublin's Croke Park as Dan Parks kicked a last-minute penalty for a personal haul of 18 points. France then defeated Martin Johnson's much-criticized England team 12-10 in Paris to end the tournament with five wins from five, clinching their first such Grand Slam since 2004. England led with a sixth-minute try from Ben Foden, but France built a 12-7 halftime advantage thanks to three penalties from Morgan Parra and a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc. Jonny Wilkinson, dropped to the bench for only the third time in his 12-year career but brought on as a replacement for center Riki Flutey, kicked the only points of the second half. Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll scored an 11th minute try to give his side a perfect start, but Scotland moved into a 17-7 lead thanks to a try from No. 8 James Beattie and three penalties and a drop-goal from Parks. Tommy Bowe crossed for a controversial try to put Ireland level, awarded with 16 minutes to play despite appearing not to properly ground the ball, but Parks held his nerve to give the visitors their first win of the tournament. Scotland's victory, coming after last weekend's 15-15 draw with England, condemned Italy to bottom place. Wales finished fourth for the second year in a row after beating the Italians 33-10 in Cardiff earlier on Saturday, with center James Hook scoring two tries.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"France win the Six Nations rugby title for the first time since 2007 .\\nIreland had to beat Scotland to have a chance of retaining title but lost to Scotland .\\nFrance then beat England 12-10 in final game of tournament to clinch Grand Slam of wins .\\nWales finish fourth for second year in a row after beating bottom side Italy 33-10 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nIn the latest in our regular series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, champion skier Chemmy Alcott talks the marvels of Maui and what not to eat in Japan. Favourite childhood holiday? When I was three, we went to Crete, and a beautiful starfish floated up to me in the water and wrapped itself round my leg. I felt so connected with the sea. Top travel tip? Stay hydrated, use an eye mask - and enjoy the journey. Chemmy Alcott: Fond of snow, dreams of Hawaii . What do you never travel without? Earplugs. I am deaf in one ear and I find that when I need to really rest, I have to block totally the hearing in both ears. Where would you go if you could live in any other country than Britain? Well, it isn't a country - but the Hawaiian island of Maui. I have lots of friends there through my best friend, Julia Mancuso. The Maui world revolves around caring for others and having fun; money rarely comes into it. Most traumatic travel experience? I stopped in Tokyo, en route to Australia, and asked a local to take me to his favourite Japanese restaurant. Desperate not to offend, I ate everything put in front of me - eyeballs and all. The next 12-hour flight wasn't the smoothest ride! Where did you last go on holiday? I spent Christmas in the mountains. The best bit was helping my young nephews master the art of skiing, and also racing around with my hubby, Dougie Crawford. What destination is on your hitlist and why? After Dougie and I got married, we made a bucket list that includes everything from drinking a mojito and salsa dancing in a bodega bar in Havana to sipping chai tea at the Taj Mahal, heliskiing in Alaska, cat-skiing in Japan and ski-touring in Iceland. Favourite hotel in the world? I have just stayed at the most incredible chalet in Val d'Isere called Marco Polo - an alpine, Balinese fusion filled with unique art, and with a massive bath made from one slab of beautiful stone. I didn't want to leave. Next big adventure? I'm taking part in the world's toughest ski race in Greenland next month, alongside the Arctic V (endurance experts Max Willcocks, Adam Libbey, Richard Gibbs and Chris Brooks).

Associated Press . The principal of a Catholic elementary school in suburban Philadelphia is apologizing to parents for having used a photo of Ellen DeGeneres on an invitation to an Oscars-themed graduation dance. St. Andrew Elementary School principal Nancy Matteo wrote in an email to parents on Tuesday that using the photo was 'completely wrong' because DeGeneres 'lives her life outside the teachings of the Catholic Church'. News site philly.com said it obtained the text of the email on Tuesday. The note doesn't specifically mention DeGeneres' sexual orientation but calls her a 'poor role model'. The principal of a Catholic school in Bucks County apologized to parents on Tuesday for using a photo of Ellen DeGeneres on an invitation to an Oscars-themed graduation dance, and is demanding students return them to be destroyed . DeGeneres came out as gay in 1997 and married actress Portia de Rossi in 2008. 'A role model, as defined by Webster's Dictionary, is a person who is unusually effective or inspiring in some social role, job, position, etc,' the email said. 'This does not describe her at all. We work so hard to be good role models and then I go and do something stupid!' Principal Nancy Matteo said in a letter that using the picture of Ellen was 'completely wrong' DeGeneres hosted the Oscars in 2007 and 2014. The image on the invitation for the June 8 dance shows her holding an Oscar statue accompanied by the phrase 'Live from the red carpet.' Matteo, who declined to comment on the email to Philly.com, said in the email that she was 'obviously NOT thinking' when she included the photo. She asked that the invitations be returned so she can destroy them and distribute new ones. Spokesman Ken Gavin of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said the Bucks County principal apologized of her own accord after parents questioned the photo. He said Catholic schools are 'firmly rooted in Gospel-based values and the teachings of the Church' and any promotional materials developed by the schools are expected to 'feature images and themes that correspond with their core mission and identity'. 'That approach is logical and our school families have a right to expect it,' he said. The text of the email, which was obtained by philly.com, didn't specifically mention the star's sexual orientation but called her a 'poor role model'.

Richard Shears . On screen they are usually portrayed as mortal enemies, but a cat that was dying after eating rat poison was saved thanks to a blood transfusion - from a dog. The rare operation was carried out by New Zealand vet Kate Heller, who realised that Rory the cat would not survive unless he was given an immediate blood transfusion. Unfortunately his blood type was not known and to have performed the delicate operation with the wrong type of blood - which for cats falls into categories A, B or AB - could have proved fatal. Critical: Ginger tabby, Rory, similar to this one pictured here, was saved by a blood transfusion from a dog . But decisive action was imperative because without it Rory was in equal danger of using up the last of his nine lives. Rory's owner Kim Edwards rushed him to Tauranga Vets after she heard him howling in pain and unable to move. When she got there she found the blood laboratory was closed and it was not possible to determine Rory's . blood type. After consulting colleagues, Miss Heller decided to take a chance and perform the operation on the sick feline using dog's blood. She said: 'If . we didn't do it, he would have died, so we had nothing to lose by . giving it a go. It was a do or die, but it's very . uncommon.' Studies have shown that cats might . not have such an adverse reaction to it no matter what the type, than . they might to the wrong type of cat blood. Saviour: A black Labrador called Macy, similar to this one here, was responsible for donating the blood . Miss Heller, of Tauranga, told the Bay of Plenty Times: 'Inter-species blood transfusions are not common, nor are they recommended.' Miss Edwards called a friend from her book club who owns a pet Labrador called Macy. She agreed to letting her dog be used for the transfusion. According to Miss Heller, Rory had been 'really flat and . gasping and howling' before the operation. But the transfusion worked so well that an . hour after the transfusion he was purring and tucking into a bowl of . biscuits. Miss Edwards said: 'The vets just went above and beyond. It's . incredible that it worked. 'Rory is back to normal - and just for the record we don't have a cat that barks or fetch the paper!'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Vet performs rare operation on cat that was dying after eating rat poison .\\nLife or death scenario forced Tauranga vet Kate Heller to use dog blood .\\nMacy the black Labrador was rushed to the aid of ginger tabby, Rory .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- An Arkansas supermarket reversed its decision Wednesday to hide a magazine cover showing Elton John and his same-sex partner David Furnish holding their new baby. The shield placed over the current issue of Us Weekly read \"Family shield to protect young Harps shoppers.\" The Arkansas-based grocery chain lets managers at its 65 stores decide when customers complain if the shield is needed, but it is usually for photos that are \"sexually provocative or too revealing,\" Harps Food Stores President Kim Eskew said. Complaints poured into the chain's headquarters this week after photos of the shielded magazine spread across internet blogs and news websites. \"When we began receiving complaints at our corporate office, we reviewed the magazine in question, removed the shield and are selling the magazine in all our locations today without any cover,\" Eskew said Wednesday. \"Our true intention is not to offend anyone in our stores and this incident happened at just one of our 65 locations, which, when brought to our attention, we reversed.\" Us Weekly West Coast Bureau Chief Melanie Bromley, who wrote the cover story, said the issue has been a good seller for her magazine. \"It's been very compelling for them (readers) and people have really felt the emotion with them (John and Furnish),\" Bromley said. \"So people have wanted to read about it and see the first pictures of little Zachary.\" Bromley's seen no complaints from readers about having a gay couple with a baby on the magazine's cover. \"As far as I'm aware there was no negative feedback at all,\" she said. \"I had not one email of any negative message at all. The only kind of feedback I got was positive, that people are so happy for them.\" People Magazine put another same-sex couple with their newborns on front of its January 10, 2011 issue. But the photo of Neil Patrick Harris and partner David Burtka with their twins was only a small image on the margin of the cover. When People featured photos of Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi when they married in 2008, it was one of the magazine's best-selling issues that year, a spokeswoman said.

Leon Watson . Tampa Bay have become the fifth NFL team to get served with a lawsuit from its cheerleaders, it emerged today. Papers were filed against the Buccaneers by former cheerleader Manouchcar Pierre-Val accusing them of violating federal wage law. It follows similar actions against the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets filed by cheerleaders claiming they were underpaid. Manouchcar Pierre-Val alleges that she is owed at least minimum wage for more than 500 hours she worked for the team . In the suit, Pierre-Val's attorney . Kimberly Woods alleges many of the same facts as those that preceded it . including unpaid promotional appearances, multiple practices per week, . and several hundred hours worked for the team, all for a flat per-game . wage. Pierre-Val, 25, is a registered nurse from Orlando who cheered for the Bucs during the 2012 to 2013 season, Deadspin.com reported. During that time, her attorney said, she was paid $100 per game but worked many more unpaid hours leading cheerleading clinics, visiting charity events, posing for swimsuit calendars and practicing. 'If you do the math,' Woods said, 'you see she earned less than $2 per hour — while the minimum wage in Florida was $7.67.' Former cheerleader Manouchcar Pierre-Val (pictured) is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Pierre-Val¿s suit was filed as a class action, giving other cheerleaders for the team the option of joining the suit against the team . Since January, cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets have filed similar 'wage theft' suits . Woods also anticipated the 'you knew what you were getting into' defense, noting that one cannot waive her rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Pierre-Val is the only named plaintiff as of now and was paid $3,000 less than minimum wage during her one year with the team. Pierre-Val's attorney said she has spoken to other members of the Bucs' cheerleading squad who expressed interest in adding their names, but none have done so at this point .

Ilonen carded four birdies and no bogeys despite the windy conditions to win 3&1 and secure the first prize of €650,000 (£515,000), almost double his previous biggest payday from winning the Irish Open in June. Stenson, who had not led at any stage of his morning semi-final against George Coetzee before making a birdie on the 18th to win, claimed an early lead in the final with a birdie on the fourth. Mikko Ilonen has won the Volvo World Match Play Championship after defeating Henrik Stenson . However, the world number five then bogeyed the fifth and hit his tee shot into the water on the eighth, before birdies on the 10th and 12th took Ilonen three up. Stenson, still seeking his first win since the DP World Tour Championship in November last year which meant he became the first man to win the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same season, refused to throw in the towel and birdied the 13th to reduce his deficit. But after almost holing his chip from the back of the 14th green, the Swede could only look on as Ilonen holed from 12 feet for birdie to move three ahead again, this time with just four holes remaining. Stenson fought back once more with a two-putt birdie on the par-five 15th, but was unable to birdie either of the next two holes as Ilonen - who had beaten Joost Luiten 2&1 in the semi-finals - secured the biggest win of his career.

Shrien Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa in November. British Judge Duncan Ousely rejected concerns from the South African government that Dewani would use his funds and international connections to flee before an extradition hearing. Ben Watson, a lawyer for the South African government, cited hotel surveillance video that he said showed Dewani twice meeting with a cab driver as the sort of evidence indicating Dewani's involvement in a plot against his wife. But Ousely ruled that Dewani, who did not attend the hearing, had a genuine interest in clearing his name and said he has cooperated with investigators from both England and South Africa. Dewali's solicitor, Andrew Katzen, said he was \"delighted\" with the outcome but declined further comment following the court hearing. Dewani, who is jailed in London's Wandsworth Prison, will be allowed to stay at his parents' home. He will be required to report to a police station in Bristol every morning. A court hearing has been temporarily scheduled for Jan. 20, but it is unclear when South Africa will submit a formal extradition request. Dewani's lawyers say he is innocent and will fight extradition. Dewani's wife, Anni Dewani, died in an apparent carjacking as the couple took a taxi ride in a crime-ridden neighborhood of Cape Town. Dewani was allowed to leave South Africa, but this week prosecutors there accused him of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife. \"The alleged hijacking was in fact not a hijacking, but part of a plan of subterfuge which Shrien Dewani, the husband of the deceased and the accused, had designed to conceal the true facts ... that the deceased was murdered at the instance of the husband,\" South African prosecutors wrote in court documents. In the documents, prosecutors detail meetings that Dewani had with the taxicab driver where where he allegedly paid the driver 15,000 South African rand ($2,170) to have a crew of hitmen kill his wife and make it look like a carjacking. The court documents do not say why Dewani allegedly wanted his wife dead. The driver, Zola Tongo, was sentenced to 18 years in prison in South Africa after admitting to taking part in the killing.

The match looked headed for a draw until the prolific striker connected with Philipp Lahm's right wing cross to give Bayern a deserved victory. They had gone ahead through Franck Ribery in the first half with Mesut Ozil leveling in a rare Real Madrid attack just after the break. Gomez had endured a frustrating night, wasting an earlier gilt-edged chance to put them ahead for a second time when he shot over from close range. But he was rewarded for his persistence with his 40th goal of the season to give the Bavarian giants real hope of reaching the final which will be played in their home stadium next month. English Premier League Chelsea entertain reigning champions Barcelona in the second semifinal first leg Wednesday. La Liga leaders Real had gone into their away tie as favorites to progress, but from the early moments it was clear Bayern would be a difficult proposition. Ribery felt he should have had a penalty when his shirt was tugged by Sergio Ramos, but English referee Howard Webb waved away the protests. The French international did not have long to wait to be celebrating as he latched on to a loose ball in the Real penalty area from a corner and lashed his shot past Iker Casillas. Gomez had the first of his chances before halftime as Casillas turned behind his shot and it looked to be costly as Real equalized in the 53rd minute. Cristiano Ronaldo wasted the first chance as his weak shot was saved by Manuel Neuer. But Karim Benzema picked up the rebound and his shot across the goal came to Ronaldo, who cut it back for Ozil to shoot home from close range. It was the precursor for a good spell for Real but Bayern regrouped and began to create opportunities again. Gomez lifted his effort over in the 71st minute and then headed straight at Casillas. He also had penalty appeals waved away before striking late in typical fashion after superb work from the tireless Lahm. Real boss Jose Mourinho, whose team face an El Clasico showdown with Barcelona Saturday, is still confident his team will progress. \"We have the second leg to come and it's not like we have to make a historical comeback, what we have to do is very achievable,\" he told gathered reporters. \"If we win at home, we are there.

The North Carolina-based headquarters of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority also suspended the chapter at Rutgers, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. That means the sorority has ceased to be officially recognized and can accept no new recruits while the investigation is under way. Police have charged six sorority members with aggravated hazing, which a police spokesman Friday called a possible \"indictable offense.\" Rutgers Police Lt. Richard Dinan said the six women were taken to the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Facility, and bail was set at $1,500 for each. At least four of the woman have posted bail, he said. He declined to give details of the alleged hazing, but said one woman sought medical attention for non-life-threatening injuries. Dinan told The Star-Ledger newspaper in Newark Wednesday that there were at least three victims, but police may identify more victims and more suspects. He said four sorority members were arrested Tuesday and two more on Wednesday. He said the hazing occurred at a university student apartment building, but he declined to give the location. The hazing began about the middle of January and went on for eight days, he said. Dinan also told the newspaper that the alleged victims were \"unofficial pledges\" because the alleged hazing did not occur during the university's recognized pledge period. Sigma Gamma Rho is a recognized sorority, but it does not have a sorority house in New Brunswick, Dinan said. The police officer said five of the undergraduates charged were from New Jersey: Vanessa Adegbite, 21, of Jersey City; Joana Bernard, 21, of West Orange; Kesha Cheron, 20, of Newark; Shawna Ebanks, 21, of East Orange; and Marie Charles, 21, of West Orange. Llana Warner, 20, is from New York City. E. J. Miranda, a spokesman for Rutgers, said a student and her parents reported the alleged hazing to the university administration Tuesday. According to the university's statement, \"After receiving this information, university officials contacted the police.\" Miranda said he didn't know whether the sorority had had similar reports before. According to Rutgers, the university \"strictly prohibits all forms of hazing. Under the Code of Student Conduct, a student found to have engaged in hazing may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Members of Sigma Gamma Rho at Rutgers charged with aggravated hazing .\\nOne woman sought medical attention for non-life-threatening injuries, police say .\\nSorority chapter is suspended by university and by its national headquarters .\\nAlleged hazing occurred at university student apartment building, police say .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- When Seattle pot smokers got the munchies this weekend, the cops had their back. Now that marijuana is legal in Washington, there's not much police could do about weed-toting revelers at the city's Hempfest. But they did want to explain the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state -- and hit upon a novel distribution format: Doritos. Sticking the cops' messages on something edible was a no-brainer, Seattle police Sgt. Sean Whitcomb said. \"We knew if we did leaflets, it would turn into litter,\" he said. \"We wanted people to be able to access the information. It's actually fun to read. We wanted to do it in a way that is deliberately ironic.\" Each bag contained some sage Dos and Don'ts. The Don'ts included \"Don't drive while high,\" and \"Don't use pot in public. You could be cited but we'd rather give you a warning.\" And the Dos? \"Do listen to Dark Side of the Moon at a reasonable volume.\" The crowd ate it up. In less than 30 minutes, police ran out of all 1,000 bags of chips during #OperationOrangeFingers. CNN iReport: Photos of Operation Orange Fingers . Minor marijuana possession has been the Seattle's police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. Initiative 502 says residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. There are also guidelines for the possession of oils and edibles. Hempfest, which began Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is \"to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications.\" The Seattle Police Foundation paid $260 for the Doritos, CNN affiliate KING said. \"I initially said let's try 500 Dorito bags, but we did a thousand. Ultimately our goal was to start a conversation,\" Whitcomb said. And it's worked. Some even tried hawking the Doritos bags on eBay. By the end of the giveaway, even the cops were feeling the effects of Hempfest. \"We're headed home. Feelin' kinda Spacey,\" the department tweeted, with a picture of actor Kevin Spacey speaking into a walkie-talkie. At least 1,000 revelers were cured of the munchies, with a little more knowledge of the state law and a little more orange on their fingers. CNN's Elliott C.

The Omanis' nine points are now two better than both Australia and Jordan, but the latter pair have a match in hand. This will be played when the Socceroos, who have qualified for the last two World Cups, host Jordan in Melbourne next Tuesday. The result of that match will determine what each team needs to do in their final qualifier on June 18, when Group B concludes with Australia at home again, against Iraq, while Oman travel to Jordan. Japan's next commitment is the forthcoming Confederations Cup in Brazil, a warmup event for 2014's four-yearly showpiece. Zaccheroni's Asian champions play hosts Brazil in the competition's opening game on June 15. Elsewhere in Asia, former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has been named head coach of Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R & F. The Swede, who has also coached Manchester City, Lazio, Roma and Ivory Coast during a 36-year managerial career, has left his post as technical director of United Arab Emirates club Al Nasr. \"The club's board of directors has today officially hired Sven-Goran Eriksson as Guangzhou football coach until December 2014,\" read a statement from the club, which is 13th in the 16-team CSL. \"Coach Li Bing will from today no longer serve as the acting head coach.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Japan becomes the first country to qualify for 2014 World Cup in Brazil .\\nKeisuke Honda's 91st-minute penalty secures a 1-1 draw with Australia .\\nJapan will now head to Brazil for the forthcoming Confederations Cup .\\nSven-Goran Eriksson appointed head coach of Chinese club Guangzhou R & F .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nFacebook has revealed that the majority of photos which users flagged as 'offensive' during 2011 are actually just unflattering . Facebook has revealed that the majority of photos which users flagged as 'offensive' during 2011 are actually just ones people are embarassed about. The company revealed that no matter how much you dislike a photo, it won't take it down simply because you don't like how you like - or even if you're caught doing something you want to hide. When Facebook investigates an 'offensive' post, it will take it down only if it proves to be genuinely offensive. The company's engineering director, Arturo Bejar, revealed in a radio interview that the majority of reports of 'offensive' pictures in 2011 weren't actually offensive, when the company investigated - they're just pictures that people don't like. People don't own the copyright to photographs other people have taken of them, even on Facebook, so the site will not remove an image simply because someone doesn't like it. 'So we usually sit down with the people who process the reports as . they come in,' said Bejar. 'We're going for . photo after photo, and they're reported for violence or . drug use or pornography. 'And we're looking at the photos and we're . there's absolutely nothing wrong with that photo. That photo is fine.' 'Then we noticed that the . person who was reporting the photo happens to be in the photo. And so we . began digging.' There are more than 250 million photos posted to Facebook every day. In the interview, on NPR's 'Talk of the Nation', Bejar spoke to someone who wanted a photo of them at a political meeting removed in case it offended their boss. He said that Facebook would not remove photos for that reason, and advised the user to contact the photographer instead. Last year, so many people 'misused' the option to report 'Offensive' posts that Facebook added another option to the page, to allow miffed users to message their friends and ask them to take the pictures down. In the new version of the page, users are given the option to flag a picture as 'I don't like this picture of me,' or 'This picture is harassing me' which will send a message to the person who posted it. Facebook claims that this move helps people resolve picture problems. The blog AllThingsD commented, 'The thing is, you don’t necessarily own the rights to a picture someone else takes of you, and Facebook accentuates the awkwardness of that situation.' 'Since Facebook users upload an average of more than 250 million photos per day, this is a way for the company to patrol its site without employing warehouses full of people scanning pictures for violence and nudity.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"250 million photos posted to site every day .\\nMajority of 'offensive photo' reports in 2011 were just unflattering photos .\\nFacebook won't help if photo is just embarassing .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLos Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Glenn Close said she is \"distraught\" that her image was used in one of a series of profanity- and slur-laden videos aboard the Navy's USS Enterprise. \"The cynical, unauthorized use of my image in this video is deeply offensive and insulting, and was the result of a seemingly innocent request made during a visit to an aircraft carrier over four years ago,\" Close said, according to a statement from publicist Catherine Olim on Tuesday.

Police say a CNN viewer in Maryland identified the young woman, who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home or even her own name. The 18 year old whose name is not yet being released, is in the process of being reunited with her family. They are from Washington state and are on their way to New York, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said on Saturday. A photo of the woman, who has been referred to as Jane Doe, was circulated by police and aired on CNN this week. The viewer in Maryland was familiar with her situation and knew she had been missing from her family earlier this month. The girl was found in Midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. \"I just want to know who I am,\" the girl said in a statement from the New York City Administration for Children's Services. \"I want to know who I am and what happened to me.\" According to its Web site, \"Covenant House New York is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth.\" Nearly 7,000 youths reportedly seek shelter there per year. A security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department. Police officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. The police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered. The children's services agency said the girl recently wrote down the name \"Amber\" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name. On another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel \"Fool's Fate\" by Robin Hobb. The girl also is apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, \"who's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom,\" the young woman said. Judging from her poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appeared to have been living on the streets for some time.

Nearly: Graham DeLaet of Canada salutes the crowd after sinking a putt for a birdie on the eighth hole . Furyk, the 2006 and 2007 champion in this event, started from the 10th and after an opening par, kick-started his group's blistering scoring with four straight birdies. He gained further shots at the first, sixth and eighth in a blemish-free round. Home favourite DeLaet, who lies two shots off the lead in third, could not say the same after bogeying the 18th and fourth but recorded nine birdies in a superb round. The third member of the group, Matt Kuchar, was only two shots outside his playing partners' pace with a 65 to reach six under and a share of ninth place. Furyk told pgatour.com: 'I don't know if I've ever played in a group where we shot 63, 63, 65. I was giving 'Kuch' a bunch of crap for being the schlub in the group, shooting a 65.' DeLaet added: 'All of us were making so many birdies out there. You felt like you had to make putts just to keep up.' Kyle Stanley was alongside DeLaet on eight under, with Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell among the group at seven under after a bogey-free 65. He was joined by Americans Justin Hicks, Scott Brown and Andrew Svoboda. Dustin Johnson was a notable name to miss the cut, a second-round 68 not enough to make up for his opening 74, while Hunter Mahan toppled out of the tournament with a 75 featuring seven bogeys.

Lugo fired the commanders of the country's army, air force and navy on Wednesday. The armed forces commander, Rear Adm. Cibar Benitez Caceres, had been the only top official to survive Wednesday's dismissals. Lugo has given no reason for the firings, publicly denying rumors of a coup plot. Benitez Caceres will be replaced as armed forces chief by Brig. Gen. Juan Oscar Velazquez Castillo, the president's executive order said. The handover ceremony was scheduled to take place Friday afternoon. The military held a ceremony Thursday for the new army, navy and air force commanders. Lugo did not attend. Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was installed as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro took over the top post at the air force and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas, at the navy. Benitez had said at Thursday's swearing-in ceremony that other changes would be coming in the lower ranks, but denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. Some opposition politicians said Friday that Lugo, a leftist, is trying to install military commanders more in tune with his political and ideological leanings. Opposition Sen. Enrique Gonzalez Quintana was quoted in the Neike.com digital newspaper as saying Lugo has an agenda similar to that of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged in 1989 from Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year dictatorship. There were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. Friday's military shakeup is the fourth since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year, bringing an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay. But the goodwill did not last long. In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. Three women have accused him of fathering a child. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature.

Defending world champion Stoner was battling with his Repsol Honda colleague Pedrosa at the Sachsenring before sliding off his bike prior to the final few corners. The Australian's error handed Jorge Lorenzo second place and means he now leads the world championship standings by 16 points from Pedrosa. Stoner slipped to third and was distraught to have thrown away a winning position. He told the BBC: \"I'm pretty disappointed, I had planned to go for my 'win or bin' effort in the last corner not that one! \"I felt confident but as soon as I tried to turn in a little more, the front went. I was already off the brakes and not in the hard braking area, as soon as I eased of the brakes I guess the weight came off the front and down I went. \"I'm frustrated I wasn't allowed to get up and try and score some points, the bike was perfect, but the marshals pushed me away. \"If we can continue this momentum for the rest of the season then we shouldn't be so worried for the championship.\" It was Pedrosa's third consecutive German MotoGP victory and he was quickest off the blocks, beating Stoner, who started on pole, to the first corner from third spot. Stoner did reclaim the lead by the end of the opening lap and as the race went on, the pair pulled away from Lorenzo who was a full eight seconds back. But Stoner lost his front wheel going into to one of the final turns and ended up unhurt on the gravel, ensuring a smooth last few corners for Pedrosa. After the race the Spaniard told reporters: \"At the start I wasn't comfortable because of changes to my bike. As I became used to all the changes I passed Casey, and was feeling good. \"Towards the end I had to fight for the win, on the last lap I was racing at my maximum.\" The next race on the MotoGP calendar takes place in Italy on July 15. MotoGP standings: . 1. Jorge Lorenzo (Spa) Yamaha 160 points . 2. Dani Pedrosa (Spa) Honda 146 points . 3. Casey Stoner (Aus) Honda 140 points . 4. Andrea Dovizioso (Ita) Yamaha 92 points . 5.

Holyfield (right) grimaces after being bitten by Tyson in their 1997 fight. Holyfield took Tyson's crown in an epic bout in 1996, but it was their second fight a year later that is remembered for all the wrong reasons with Tyson disqualified for biting a chunk out of his opponent's ear. Holyfield, 45, has revealed he is considering an offer from 41-year-old Tyson's camp to meet in the ring for a third time. \"There has been some talk between us,\" Holyfield told The Guardian newspaper on Thursday. \"Mike had Jeff Fenech, who's been training him, call me a few months ago. Jeff says Mike wants to fight me again - but he needs to know if I would agree to it. \"I said, 'It all depends on what they are going to give us - because I'm gonna catch a lot of flak if I say I'm fighting Mike Tyson again. I've already said I don't want to fight Mike no more'. \"Jeff says, 'What if Mike gets in proper shape?' I told him that's OK but I can't be part of it if Mike's going to pull out. Jeff said, 'The main thing Mike wants to know is if you would be willing to fight him again?' I said, 'Yeah, if the price is right, I probably would'.\" Both fighters have made largely unsuccessful attempts at comebacks in recent years with Holyfield continuing his pursuit of an unlikely fifth title against the advice of boxing experts. He is believed to have held on to a large portion of his career earnings, but, by contrast, Tyson has suffered well-publicized financial problems.

Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant in the Saturday incident, according to Houston Police spokesman John Cannon. United Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board Saturday, Cannon said. The airline workers determined he was too intoxicated to board the flight, but they wanted a police supervisor to decide if he was a candidate for a sobering center instead of being jailed for public intoxication, he said. Guiry became agitated and made repeated threats to the police sergeant after he was told he could go to the sobering center if he was compliant, Cannon said. After the threats, the officer told the actor he was under arrest, he said.  Guiry allegedly tried to kick the sergeant in the face as he was placing him under arrest. The head-butting happened as the sergeant tried to restrain him, Cannon said. Guiry was 11 when he made his acting debut in the film \"The Sandlot.\" His career as a child actor also included the lead role in a \"Lassie\" movie remake in 1994 and \"The Last Home Run\" in 1996.  He's acted in several television series in recent years, including a recent episode of \"Elementary.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant .\\nUnited Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board .\\nPolice: Guiry, who workers said was drunk, head-butted cop as he tried to restrain him .\\nGuiry's career as a child actor included the lead role in a 1994 \\\"Lassie\\\" remake .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Rapper MC Hammer launched a string of tweets Saturday with his side of the story two days after he was arrested in northern California for allegedly obstructing an officer. Among his tweets, Hammer said, apparently referring to the arresting officer, that he was asked whether he was on parole or probation before the man tried to pull him out of his vehicle Thursday night. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. \"After asking Hammer who the registered owner was he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions,\" police spokesman Herb Walters wrote Saturday evening in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer -- a rap and dance icon in the late 1980s and 1990s -- was arrested on suspicion of resisting an officer and obstructing an officer in the performance of his duties, according to police spokesman Herb Walters. The incident occurred at the Hacienda Crossings shopping center. Hammer began his tweets Saturday with \"chubby elvis looking dude was tapping on my car window, I rolled down the window and he said 'Are you on parole or probation?'\" \"While I was handing him my ID he reached in my car and tried to pull me out the car but forgot he was on a steady donut diet,\" Hammer continued. \"It was comical to me until he pulled out his guns, blew his whistle and yelled for help (MallCop) !!! But make no mistake he's dangerous.\" Hammer, 50, was booked and released on bail from Santa Rita Jail, Walters said. A court date is next month, and police have until that time to decide on any charges. No drugs or alcohol were suspected in the incident, police said. In another tweet, Hammer, born Stanley Kirk Burrell, said, \"only thing more dangerous than a scared man with a gun, is a scared man with an agenda, a gun and a badge.\" \"I will now answer his question, contrary to his personal beliefs, all people of color are not on parole or probation fat boy!!!,\" wrote Hammer, later adding he thought of his arrest as \"a teachable moment\" and an \"eye opener.\" Hammer, who had a hit single in 1990 with \"U Can't Touch This,\" has been enjoying a resurgence in his career and took the stage with \"Gangnam Style\" Korean performer Psy during the American Music Awards last November. Hammer performed \"Too Legit to Quit,\" which was released more than 20 years ago.

Van Exel was released on $25,000 bond, said Executive Chief Deputy Jesse Flores of the Dallas County Sheriff's Department. Van Exel is charged in the shooting of Bradley Bassey Eyo, 23, in the Dallas suburb of Garland. Eyo's body was dumped near Lake Ray Hubbard, authorities said, and had an apparent gunshot wound to the upper body. Police found the remains on Sunday and arrested Van Exel on Wednesday, authorities said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WFAA, Eyo's father said police told him that Van Exel said the shooting was an accident. \"They were playing with a shotgun, and when it went off on Bradley, he didn't know what to do, took his body and dumped it on the street,\" the father told WFAA. Authorities told reporters that they reviewed the case closely before making it a capital offense. \"If a person is making the assertion this was an accident -- you place the body in a vehicle and moved it to a second location -- that in itself, coupled with the fact that property is missing, makes this a capital murder,\" said Deputy Chief Craig Miller. A cell phone and shoes were the missing property, said Dallas police spokesman Kevin Janse. Paul Johnson, Van Exel's attorney, told CNN the shooting was the result of \"horseplay.\" \"The young men were involved in a bunch of horseplay. They didn't believe it was loaded and, unfortunately, it was,\" Johnson said. \"Unfortunately, there was a tragic result to the horseplay.\" The two men had been friends for years and were neighbors who lived across the street from each other, Johnson said. Van Exel does not live with his father, Johnson said. \"Everybody considered them to be like brothers,\" the attorney said of the two young men. When asked why Van Exel allegedly moved the body, Johnson said Van Exel went \"into a state of shock and panic.\" \"When it occurred, there was no question his friend was deceased,\" Johnson said. Van Exel tried to call his family, but he \"couldn't get a hold of anybody,\" Johnson said. \"You are talking about a 20-year-old boy.\" Van Exel and Johnson went to police and cooperated, Johnson said. Van Exel consented to have his home and vehicle searched, Johnson said. Johnson described the families of the two young men as close. \"There has been communication between the families since the incident,\" Johnson said. The elder Van Exel became player development instructor for the Atlanta Hawks in September after serving as an assistant coach at Texas Southern University, according to the Hawks' website. Van Exel, 39, played 13 seasons in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Portland Trailblazers and San Antonio Spurs, the website said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Nickey Van Exel is son of ex-NBA player, current Atlanta staff member Nick Van Exel .\\nNickey Van Exel faces murder charge in the shooting of his friend, police say .\\nHis attorney says the shooting was an accident that occurred during \\\"horseplay\\\"\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThe teenager who stabbed his teacher to death in a brutal classroom killing is getting 'fanmail' from deluded youngsters, it emerged today. Mixed-up teenagers have gone online to praise Will Cornick, the murderer of Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, and he is reportedly being sent letters from admiring peers. Some youngsters have even used the term 'good times' - the words uttered by Cornick in the moments after his horrific attack - as a sickening catchphrase. Will Cornick (left) was jailed for at least 20 years for the murder of teacher Ann Maguire (right). He is now reportedly receiving 'fanmail' after youngsters praised him online . Cornick, 16, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of the popular teacher at Corpus Christi College in Leeds in April this year. But a Facebook group set up in his name has seen some teenage girls claim they find the 16-year-old killer attractive. After website users attacked Cornick, one girl wrote: 'Calm down. I love Will!!!' in a comment that was then 'liked' by a friend. In another 'liked' comment, a schoolgirl wrote: 'He's so buff.' When asked what she meant, she replied: 'Good looking.' One girl even repeated the phrase Cornick used after he stabbed his teacher, writing  'good times' on the page, followed by a thumbs up symbol. Again, her comment was 'liked' by others. Cornick's own Facebook page (pictured) has been taken down, but 'community pages' with comments about him have sprung up since his sentencing . The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK . Another message on the page comes from an Italian girl who is trying to get in contact with Cornick,  saying she feels 'sorry for' him and describing him as a 'friend'. The online comments emerged as it was reported that Cornick has received messages from teenagers around the world as he begins his prison term. The Daily Star quoted a source close to the case who claimed: 'He is getting letters from boys and girls from England, the US and Australia. Some are from girls saying he is cute and they want to marry him.' Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released. Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Cornick murdered teacher Mrs Maguire in classroom attack in April .\\nHe was jailed earlier this month and told he may never be freed .\\nDespite his horrific crime, some youngsters have praised him online .\\nHe is reportedly also getting 'fanmail' sent to his prison cell .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A shooting suspect and one of three people he shot Tuesday at a Dallas Area Rapid Transit station just north of Dallas have died of their wounds, officials said.

One of them later died. Richardson Police spokesman Kevin Perlich told reporters during a press conference at the scene. It was unclear if they were hit by crossfire or were targeted by the gunman, Perlich said. The suspect fled to a warehouse across the street, where he died of a gunshot wound to the head, Perlich said. He did not know if the gunshot was self-inflicted or if the suspect was shot by police during a shootout at the vacant building. Several dozen people were evacuated at the DART station.

South Korea's Kospi Index fell 4.9% to 1,750.60 in mid-morning trading in Seoul before climbing slightly to 1,766,82 to be 4% off by midday. Key stocks tumbled, with Samsung Electronics, the largest stock on the Kospi, falling 3.5% and LG Display, the world's second largest panel maker, down 7.2% in early trading. Already battered by fears that possible credit downgrades in European countries could derail a solution to the euro zone debt crisis, Asian markets fell across the board. Enigmatic North Korean leader Kim Jong Il dies at the age of 69 . At the open, Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 1.1 % at 8,304.47, Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 2.5%t to 17,833.42 and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.6% to 2,167.68. June Park, senior economist at Meritz Securities, told Reuters.com the death of Kim Jong Il had rattled investor confidence. \"This is definitely negative factor for markets with no detailed information on his death. It will drive the stock markets lower and the Korean won to depreciate sharply as geopolitical risks are rising and foreign investors could withdraw money out of South Korea,\" she said. With South Korea's military on \"high alert\" and South Korea's President Lee Myun Bak convening a national security council meeting, Markets in Taiwan, the prospect of further instability caused by succession problems in North Korea also weighed on markets across the region. Markets in Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia also fell.

Yesterday Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation’s management standards committee (MSC), set up internally to investigate business practices, believed that by handing material on individual employees to police it would save the company. But police denied any deal was done. Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation management standards committee believed that by handing material on employees to police it would save the company . The revelation came in the trial of six senior Sun journalists accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade. Head of news, Chris Pharo, 45, picture editor John Edwards, 50, managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporters Jamie Pyatt, 51, and John Troup, 49, are accused of conspiring to corrupt public officials, paying for information about celebrities, murderers and royals. All six deny the charges. Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Pharo, said: ‘They (MSC) were keen to be seen to co-operate with the police.’ Detective Superintendent Mark Kandiah agreed: ‘They certainly were co-operative.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘In slang, they were shopping their own staff.’ The company received a letter in May 2012 from the CPS informing them a corporate liability charge was a possibility. Minutes of a meeting a month later between the MSC and police indicated committee chairman Lord Grabiner was not sure the firm would have assisted ‘if they had been told this last year’. Six senior Sun journalists are accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade and are on trial at Kingston Crown Court, pictured . In another meeting News Corporation lawyer Gerson Zweifach said 46,000 jobs were at risk. The minutes read: ‘It [a prosecution] could kill the corporation. This job [co-operating with police] was to defend the company... The downstream effect of a prosecution would be devastating and apocalyptic.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘The point he was making was if the company was charged, rather than individual employees...the company could go bust.’ The trial continues.

The Dutchman, who had a troubled stay on Merseyside after being signed by David Moyes in 2005, played with Ibrahimovic during the Sweden striker's time at Ajax between 2001 and 2003. Although Messi and Ronaldo are widely regarded as the game's standout players, Van der Meyde insists that the Paris Saint Germain forward deserves to be recognised in the same company. Zlatan Ibrahimovic should be recognised as one of the world's best players, says Andy van der Meyde . Lionel Messi (L) and Cristiano Ronaldo (R) are widely regarded as the best two players on the planet . The Paris Saint Germain talisman arrives for training at his former club Ajax's Amsterdam ArenA . 'Ibrahimovic is one of the best players in the world with Messi and Ronaldo,' Van der Meyde told Goal.com. 'He is such a big and strong guy. He can be an intimidating figure. Plus he has amazing technique as well for someone with a big body like his. 'He's the type of player who wants to win at all costs. He is arrogant, but that's him. It's a positive sort of arrogance if you ask me. He is a true great.' Van der Meyde (L) spent a troubled time at Everton, making just 20 league appearances between 2005-09 . Van der Meyde was stunned by a young Ibrahimovic's talent during their time together at Ajax . Despite retiring from football in 2011, Van der Meyde still recalls how Ibrahimovic's feats in training left him and his teammates breathless. 'We didn't need long to realise that he was going to be a great player. He did things on the training pitch where we could only look on with our mouths open out of admiration. 'The kind of actions he makes now as well, with his acrobatic backheels. Although he didn't really managed to perform during games early on.'

The mother of a TV star who repeatedly punched a man in the face in an argument over his 27-year-old girlfriend has defended her son's actions, saying 'he's not a thug'. MasterChef presenter Greg Wallace hit magazine publisher Paul Bates after he allegedly groped his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini. Now his mother Mary Pettman, 68, has said she is glad her son 'defended' Miss Sterpini and described him as a 'very caring man'. Gregg Wallace fought Paul Bates believing he had touched the MasterChef judge's girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini (pictured). His mother has defended his actions . Mrs Pettman, of Whitstable Kent, said reports about the fight 'made her son look like a thug, which he isn’t'. 'I’m sorry that it has given a lot of jealous and judgmental people a reason to pillory him,' she tweeted. Wallace said he 'did what any bloke would do' after punching a diner 'at least five times' at an event at the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire. Attack: Diners grab MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace as he grapples with Paul Bates (right). Mr Bates, is a father of two whose company Raw Media publishes Cotswold Style magazine . He started a drunken brawl with Paul Bates, a magazine publisher who the TV star claims also made 'inappropriate comments' to Anne-Marie Sterpini. Wallace is said to have rained blows on the 55-year-old as they grappled on the floor in front of shocked guests at the £75-a-head event on Saturday evening. But Mr Bates, who had taken his daughter to the the five-course dinner at a luxury Worcestershire hotel, accused the greengrocer of ‘turning on him out of the blue’. The fight happened at an event at the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire . Mrs Pettman cast doubt on the man's version of events, adding: 'Are we meant to believe that a totally blameless man was attacked for no reason, but refuses to involve the police? Something whiffs here.' Miss Sterpini also defended the TV star, telling The Mirror: 'Gregg saw that I was close to tears and asked me what had happened. 'I told him and he reacted by shouting at the man and which then led to the fight. He was protecting me.' Wallace faces a grilling by ‘very senior’ BBC staff after his recent, leaving his future on the popular cooking show, where he earns an estimated £250,000 a year, in doubt. Last week it was reported that the hotel chain that hosted the event, a five hour feast called 'Dinner with Gregg Wallace' has dropped his restaurant from another of its luxury hotels. The MasterChef judge will close Gregg’s Bar and Grill, in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel, following a series of scathing reviews by critics who branded it a 'travesty' and a 'joke'.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"MasterChef judge's mother insists her son is not a thug .\\nWallace fought Paul Bates during five-course champagne reception .\\nBrawl at the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire .\\nMr Bates accused of touching Wallace's girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, 27 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAbbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- News outlets in Pakistan have made public the name of an American they identified as the CIA station chief, but a senior Pakistani intelligence official said Monday the person named is not the station chief.

Hours of firefights erupted after the militants hit an army barracks in the Loder district of Abyan province in an assault that included heavy artillery, according to the officials. The dead included 17 militants, 11 soldiers and two members of pro-government tribes, they said. This is the second militant attempt to take over Loder this year. The first was in early January. Last week, Yemen poured thousands of troops into the country's south to battle al Qaeda fighters and tighten security, officials said. Yemeni warplanes bombarded al Qaeda hideouts all week in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes in Abyan and Lahj provinces. The offensive came after militants killed dozens of troops and seized large quantities of weapons when they raided a military zone. Numerous other Yemeni soldiers were taken hostage, officials said.

This chilled-out baboon kicked back on a bench in the sunshine - and entirely refused to budge up for tired tourists. The baboon jumped in to claim the comfy seat ahead of tired walkers hiking near Victoria Falls in Zambia. Instead of moving off when they approached, these photographs show one particularly brazen one just sucking its finger in defiance. Favourite bench: A Chacma baboon reclined in the sun at Victoria Falls and decided he wasn't going to budge .

It presented the perfect photo opportunity for 33-year-old tourist Chantelle Stobbe from Saskatoon, Canada. She had just been climbing up a steep path leading to the famous waterfalls when a group of Chacma baboons ran across her. She said: 'I was wondering where all the baboons were, as I had been told there would be many. 'All of a sudden a troop of about 15 came out of nowhere. Their territory: None of the baboons felt inclined to move, however much the weary tourists wanted to sit down . Keeping an eye out: The baboons wearily watched the tourists move away from their patch . Extreme relaxation: Overwhelmed by the head of the summer months, this baboon just lay flat out on the path . There were babies and their mums, juveniles, and adults. The young ones were running around and playing. 'A large adult lay down right on the pathway blocking my way and then another climbed onto the bench. He just sat there owning it.' Baboons at Victoria Falls are famously very bold. In the past they have reportedly stolen and other items from unwitting tourists. Watchful: A baboon eyed up the hikers, clearly waiting for them to leave .

A teenage romance turned into a tragedy when police in Phoenix, Arizona, say a 15-year-old boy shot dead his ex-girlfriend before ending his own life. Matthew Bolton and 16-year-old Anastasia 'Ana' Greer were both sophomores at Sandra Day O'Connor High School, and the girl had recently broke up with the 15-year-old. According to police, the murder-suicide played out Friday at a home of Greer's friend in north Phoenix. Scroll down for vidow . Fatal attraction: Matthew Bolton, 15 (left), took his own life after murdering his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend, Anastasia Greer (right) Bloody crime scene: Neighbors of West Villa Linda reported hearing a girl screaming in terror before gunshots erupted . Police say Bolton didn't go to school that day, and it is unclear how he got the gun, which was found on a sidewalk near the bodies. Officers responded to a 911 call of a shooting around noon and found two people dead in the home's front yard from gunshot wounds. Investigators said Bolton got a ride to the home in the 4000 block of West Villa Linda and met the girl in front of the house. A neighbor, Jim Friel, told The Arizona Republic that he heard a scream and then gunshots and went across the street to the home to see what happened. Split: The murder-suicide comes just weeks after Greer broke up with Bolton, pictured here on Valentine's Day . Tribute: Friends have been leaving candles and flowers on the spot where the 16-year-old girl died from gunshot wounds to the chest . He found the girl lying on the ground with gunshot wounds to her chest and the boy with a gunshot wound to his face. Too young: Friends remembered Greer, pictured here with her Valentine's Day gift from Bolton, as a kind and outgoing girl . Grieving friends described Ana Greer as a kind and outgoing girl who was active in her school's ROTC program. Classmate Caleb Fleck told the station KPHO that Bolton, who was in his ROTC class, was well-behaved and was never known to be a troublemaker. On his Facebook page, Matthew posted on Valentine's Day a photo of him and Greer smiling and holding a red 'I love you' teddy bear with a heart-shaped nose. According police, just hours before the shooting, officials at Sandra Day O'Conner High School learned that a gun was spotted on the premises, and Bolton's name came up. Students had an early release at 11am, but security officers were unable to locate the 16-year-old or the weapon on campus. Henry Gano, who was in the area of Villa Linda Friday morning, said he noticed what he initially thought to be a couple of teens chasing one another and horsing around â€“ that is until he saw a gun in the boyâ€™s hand.

But it seems the cuddly bear has got himself into stranger predicament, after he was flushed down the toilet. Along with a pink bike and a fax machine, the stuffed bear was among the unusual objects clogging sewers last year. Blocked by Pooh: The teddy bear was found in a sewer in East Kilbride, Scotland . The items were dragged out of sewers by Scottish Water workers throughout last year. Among these were a pair of jeans, pants, mobile phones, toy soldiers, a deckchair, false teeth and a golf club. On one occasion, a credit card stolen from a Scottish Water employee turned up on the screens of the sewage works. The company said around 80 per cent of the blockages were caused by people putting the wrong things down sinks and toilets. Stuck: A pair of jeans were found blocking a pipe in Strathblane . Strange: An action man figure, a watch, a ring and a mobile phone were all said to have caused problems in drainage systems last year . Most were caused by cooking fat and oils, or bathroom waste such as cotton buds, nappies and baby wipes. The company has launched a campaign to stop people flushing rubbish down their drains, highlighting the Â£7 million annual cost to taxpayers. Chris Wallace, director of communications at Scottish Water, said: 'The waste water drain which runs from your house to the public sewer is usually only about four inches wide, which is less than the diameter of a DVD. 'This drain is designed to take only the used water from sinks, showers and baths and pee, poo and toilet paper from the toilet. 'Scottish Water believes the best way to tackle blocked drains and sewer flooding is to work with our customers to prevent blockages that can clog up the cycle in the first place.' Broken: The items, including clothing, become tangled in pipes and cause them to break.

This was the heart-stopping moment the ute driver pulled out in front of the speeding unmarked police car . The ute driver escaped getting smashed into by a just a second or two when it pulled out . The driver of the ute and unmarked police car escaped serious injury in the stunt . The video starts with the empty road in the shot and then the unmarked police car quickly appears on the right hand side of the frame. The black car goes through the green traffic light and then the white ute quickly turns the corner at the intersection and misses being in a head on crash by just a second. The policemen in the unmarked car is seen putting on their breaks very quickly which helps avoid an accident. The unmarked police car slowed down and then turned on its sirens to pull over the ute driver .

Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosni said in a statement Saturday night that efforts to recover the stolen \"Poppy Flowers\" painting are still ongoing, despite earlier reports that the painting had been returned to Cairo's Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum. Hosni said later that those reports were unconfirmed. Two Italians -- a man and a woman -- suspected of stealing the painting were preparing to board a plane to Italy when they were stopped at Cairo International Airport. An interior ministry spokesman told CNN that the man was arrested. The painting was stolen earlier Saturday. \"Poppy Flowers\" has an estimated value of about $50 million.

Ban Ki-moon said that he and Kagame spoke about the Democratic Republic of the Congo Mapping Report, which is to be released in October. Kagame complained to Ban about the leaks from the report, which alleges that the Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in Congo between 1993 and 2003. The president put his troops on alert for a possible departure from Darfur, the troubled region of Sudan where a Rwandan general leads the U.N.-African Union peacekeeping mission. \"Tens of thousands of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives, bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,\" the draft report says. Kagame, who called the allegations \"fraudulent\" and \"absurd,\" and Ban met in Kigali, Rwanda, earlier this month to discuss the report, agreeing to meet later on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting. The United Nations said that Ban \"was very satisfied\" after Sunday's meeting \"to learn that Rwanda would continue its important role in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and particularly in the strife-torn western Sudanese region of Darfur.\" The United Nations delayed release of the report by 30 days and agreed to allow nations named in it to add comments before publication. Kagame first took power on 1994 after the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. In the 100-day genocide, militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide. The killing ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Kagame was angry over U.N. report that accuses Rwandan troops of genocide .\\nU.N. agrees to allow comments to be published with report .\\nBan is \\\"very satisfied\\\" that Rwandan troops will remain in Sudan .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

A limited number of visitors already are allowed into the 30-kilometer (19-mile) exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which exploded and burned in 1986. The Ukrainian government will present a detailed plan for lifting the remaining restrictions on travel to the area December 21, said Viktor Baloga, the former Soviet republic's emergency situations minister. Background radiation in the accident zone is still well above normal. But far from being a wasteland, wildlife has rebounded in the exclusion zone and trees are reclaiming the ghost city of Pripyat, said Mary Mycio, author of \"Wormwood Forest,\" a 2005 book on the area. \"It is very moving and interesting and a beautiful monument to technology gone awry,\" Mycio said. The April 1986 accident killed 32 plant workers and firefighters directly, and the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates nearly 4,000 more will die of related cancers from the radioactive material released by the disaster. Currently, guides from the Chernobyl Zone Authority take about 20 to 30 people into the exclusion zone a day during the summers, said Yuri Rozgoni, whose Toronto-based travel agency, Ukrainianweb, books tours to the site. The tours typically take between five and six hours, not counting the drive to and from the Ukrainian capital Kiev, he said. While travel is no longer restricted to scientists and researchers, \"The only way to enter the zone (now) is with a certified guide on a certified tour group,\" Rozgoni said. \"That's a huge restriction.\" Guides monitor radiation levels and \"know where the people can go and where the people cannot go,\" he said. Mycio said tourists should wear \"something that you wouldn't mind leaving behind in case it does get dirty.\" But most radioactive material has sunk into the soil, and visitors receive a dose comparable to the exposure they would receive on a trans-Atlantic flight. \"The only concern I would have is if too many people come in and it becomes this nuclear Disneyland,\" Mycio said. \"That would take away from a wildlife sanctuary (that has thrived) in the absence of people.\" CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Ukraine will present plans to open Chernobyl next week .\\nAuthor says the site is \\\"very moving and interesting\\\"\\nAbout 20 to 30 people a day now visit during summers .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Gareth Southgate has urged his England squad not to fall into the trap he did as a player and wilt under play-off pressure. The Under-21s will discover the identity of the opponents standing in their way of Euro 2015 when the draw is made on Friday and Southgate intends to draw on personal experience to help this group through their biggest test. Saido Berahino was the star of the show in Moldova for England U21 as he bagged a brace . Southgate played in the second leg of England’s clash with Scotland at Wembley in November 1999 and he remembers how a team containing David Beckham, Michael Owen and Alan Shearer almost threw away a place at Euro 2000 as the occasion got to them. He does, however, want the Under-21s to experience the tension of a game when, potentially, one mistake could lead to a year’s work unravelling, as Southgate is adamant it will accelerate their development. ‘I played in the debacle at home,’ Southgate recalled. ‘We were under more pressure at Wembley. Everyone expected Hampden to be the game when it would be tough but Paul Scholes got a couple of goals early and it killed that match. ‘But there is something about [having a lead] that makes everyone anxious. There were top players that night who just couldn’t keep the ball. It was incredible really. I can remember some of our top players giving it away all the time. It’s something we will have to deal with.’ Harry Kane challenges for the ball during the U21 showdown between Moldova and the Young Lions . A 3-0 victory in Moldova on Tuesday stretched England’s winning run under Southgate to eight games but there is no sense that the comfortable manner in which they have been winning games will breed complacency in the group. Dangers lurk throughout the draw - Germany, Spain, France and Portugal are all in the mix, while the potential for a reunion with Serbia remains on the cards - but Southgate is happy for his squad to be scrutinised. ‘I strongly believe that if they do the right things, as they have done, then they will get there,’ said Southgate. ‘If they don’t, then it is another two big, pressure games they have been involved in. We will review it and move on. That is how it works. ‘In the club game, and in the seniors, sometimes that pressure can mean change. You have to live with that as a head coach. That’s not necessarily where we are at this age group. It is a positive pressure rather than a negative pressure. ‘We want to go and test ourselves against the best. We want to start achieving things so the other teams at St George’s see us and think “they were the first group to win the Under-21s”.’ Gareth Southgate looks on during the clash between Moldova U21 and England U21 .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Under-21s will discover the identity of the opponents standing in their way of Euro 2015 on Friday .\\nGareth Southgate intends to draw on personal experience to help this group through their biggest test .\\nSouthgate remembers how England almost threw away a place at Euro 2000 in play-off against Scotland .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Agnieszka Radwanska is already the most successful Polish female tennis player, but her achievements will reach a new level when the world rankings are released on Monday. The 22-year-old will climb to a career-high No. 5 after winning the Dubai Tennis Championships on Saturday, when she beat Germany's rising star Julia Gorges 7-5 6-4 in the final. Radwanska, the first Polish woman to pass $1 million in prize money, claimed the eighth title of her career and her first this year. She extended her record to 15-3 this season, with her only defeats coming against world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the last eight at the Australian Open and the semifinals in Sydney and Doha. Gorges, making her Dubai debut, had reached her fourth career final after knocking out Caroline Wozniacki -- Melbourne champion Azarenka's predecessor at the top -- in Friday's semis. Victory on Saturday would have seen the 23-year-old climb to a career-high 15th in the rankings, up from 19, but -- just like in the fourth round of January's opening grand slam Down Under -- she had no answer to Radwanska's game. Meanwhile, former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro reached his second successive final after beating top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Marseille Open on Saturday. The fourth-seeded Argentine, who has climbed back up the rankings to 10th after long-term wrist problems, won 6-4 6-7 (9-11) 6-3 against the French world No. 6 -- who won this tournament in 2009. Both players had reached the career milestone of 200 match wins on Friday. Del Potro, who lost to world No. 3 Roger Federer in the Rotterdam final last weekend, will face 2010 champion Michael Llodra in Sunday's final. The Frenchman went through after beating Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in the second semi. Jurgen Melzer reached the final of the Memphis hard-court event on Saturday, beating Czech third seed Radek Stepanek 6-4 3-6 6-3. The Austrian followed up Friday's win over American top seed John Isner, while Stepanek ended the hopes of 2010 winner Sam Querrey of the U.S. in their quarterfinal . Melzer will face last year's runner-up Milos Raonic on Sunday after the in-form Canadian defeated Germany's Benjamin Becker in straight sets. The 21-year-old, seeking a third ATP title of the year, took just 75 minutes to ease through 6-4 6-4. Fourth seed Raonic fired an impressive 14 aces on his way to a ninth straight victory and remains on course to add to his tournament victories in Chennai and San Jose.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska will move up one place in world rankings after Dubai win .\\nShe will move into the top five for the first time in her career having claimed eighth title .\\nJuan Martin del Potro and Michael Llodra to contest the final of the Marseille Open .\\nJurgen Melzer will face in-form Canadian Milos Raonic in the final of the Memphis event .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN)Charlie Sifford, the first African-American to play on the PGA Tour, died Tuesday at age 92, the Professional Golfers' Association of America said. \"His love of golf, despite many barriers in his path, strengthened him as he became a beacon for diversity in our game,\" PGA of America President Derek Sprague said in a statement. \"By his courage, Dr. Sifford inspired others to follow their dreams. ... Golf was fortunate to have had this exceptional American in our midst.\" Sifford was called the Jackie Robinson of golf for breaking the color barrier in 1961 when he was 38 years old. \"I wanted to prove that a black man could play golf,\" he told CNN affiliate WEWS after he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November. His son told the station that his father was advised by Robinson to use his smooth swing to fight the integration battle. \"Which I think is the way he went through his struggles -- smooth, quiet,\" Craig Sifford told the station. Unlike Robinson, who took the field with eight teammates, Charlie Sifford played an individual's game. \"It didn't bother me. It wasn't going to stop me,\" Sifford said. Tiger Woods referred to Sifford as a grandfather. \"Terrible loss for golf and me personally. My grandfather is gone, and we all lost a brave, decent and honorable man. I'll miss u Charlie,\" Woods tweeted. Jack Nicklaus said Sifford was his playing partner for the first two rounds Nicklaus played in a PGA Tour event. He called Sifford a kind and gracious gentleman. \"Charlie led by example, handling himself with great class and dignity inside and outside the ropes,\" Nicklaus said on his website. \"We can't underestimate the impact Charlie's career has had on the face of golf today. Charlie was a leader and an inspiration.\" Sifford won two PGA Tour events, his first victory coming in the 1967 Greater Hartford Open. He also won at the Los Angeles Open two years later. It was a difficult career. In his speech honoring Sifford at the White House, President Barack Obama talked about Sifford's travails. \"Charlie was sometimes banned from clubhouse restaurants. Folks threatened him, shouted slurs from the gallery, kicked his ball into the rough,\" the President said. \"Charlie's laughing about that -- my ball is always in the rough.\" On Wednesday the President said he was honored to award the golfer the Presidential Medal of Freedom \"for altering the course of the sport and the country he loved.\" People we've lost in 2015 .

David Paterson met with Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy Saturday afternoon, but the governor's spokesman said details of the meeting will be kept private. Caroline Kennedy hopes to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator. Erin Duggan, Paterson's spokesman, said the two met at the governor's Manhattan office about 2 p.m. ET. She would not disclose what the pair talked about, nor say how long the meeting lasted. Kennedy is one of the candidates hoping to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator if the Senate confirms Clinton as secretary of state. Paterson, who has the sole responsibility to replace Clinton, has been the target of intense lobbying efforts by would-be senators in recent weeks. Clinton has said she is staying out of the process of picking her successor and letting Paterson decide. Whoever the governor picks would serve for two years before running in a special election in 2010. If the candidate won that contest, that person would have to run again in 2012, when Clinton's current term ends. Paterson is a Democrat, so the seat is likely to remain in the party's hands. Kennedy, daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy and niece of longtime Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, has received the most media attention. However, critics are questioning whether she's ready to follow the political path taken by family members.  Watch Kennedy discuss political aspirations » . Kennedy, 51, has been involved in education reform and women's issues, but she has never held public office and has mostly stayed out of the public spotlight.

The Sky Sports pundit, who ditched earlier plans to power the 'carbon neutral' home with a wind turbine, was yesterday given permission to build the house in the heart of rural Lancashire by Bolton council’s planning committee. Councillor Andy Morgan, one of the committee members, said the application was innovative and that it was one of the only plans he had seen that was 'code 6' - the highest available score on a government energy rating system. Futuristic: An earlier artist's impression of Gary Neville's eco-home . Mr Morgan said: 'The turbine was the main issue for residents and it’s now gone. I believe the exceptional circumstances have been met because of code six and it is still an attractive and modern building. 'It’s not too obtrusive for residents and it’s a build which absolutely protects the environment. 'I think as a committee we should support this application.' Laa Laa Land: The innovative design is intended to have minimal impact on views of the Lancashire hills and has been likened to a Neolithic settlement . Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine were dropped by the former Manchester United player when developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power the house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West. It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and photovoltaic cells, which convert light into electricity. Mike Ralph, representing Neville, told the meeting: 'The first application generated over 100 objections, so before this new application we were careful to make sure with local residents, the plans take them into consideration. Home sweet home: Gary Neville can now look forward to building his eco-home after altering the design . 'There have been a few obstacles along the way, but the latest application only received two objections. 'There have been numerous people say to us they are grateful he has gone away and given a more thoughtful application. 'It will be smaller than before and will only take four to five months to build rather than the original 18 to 20 months.' The amount of land the five-bedroom home will take up has been also been reduced, because it will be built over two floors instead of just one storey. Much of the construction will take place off-site, reducing the time it will take to build the house and the potential noise and disturbance to neighbours.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Gary Neville's 'innovative' 5-bed eco-home designs given planning permission since abandoning wind turbine proposal .\\nWill be first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and the North West .\\nIncludes ground source heat pump and rainwater harvesting .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- A man died Tuesday at Niagara Falls from his injuries after going over a wall and falling into the gorge, authorities said.

Some time later, both fell into the gorge. The officer, who police declined to identify, sustained a broken femur and was airlifted to Hamilton General Hospital. The man who was with him died. Video from the scene first showed the rescue of the officer. A firetruck ladder extended over a cliff. Then what looked to be the second individual was raised from the gorge on a stretcher. The body was still, and wrapped in white sheets. It was loaded into a waiting ambulance. The SIU has assigned seven investigators and two forensic investigations to the case.

I've hunted ducks with Phil, the patriarch, and enjoyed Miss Kaye's home cooking. They are good, kindhearted, compassionate and generous people. The brouhaha over Phil Robertson's comments to a GQ reporter is disconcerting, not because I disagree with his views on homosexuality -- and I do, demonstrably -- but because his views are neither surprising nor unique. \"Duck Dynasty\" is a show about a Christian family. They pray at the end of every episode. They go to church, or school as Phil likes to call it. Phil's son Allen is an evangelical pastor. Phil quotes Scripture regularly on the show (and in real life.) They do not hide their Christianity, but rather they celebrate it. That Phil would therefore express a biblically literal interpretation of homosexuality may offend some, but it shouldn't surprise anyone. A&E has the right to its decision, but suspending Phil for his beliefs, even if expressed crudely, seems ungracious. The Robertsons' Christian values are, in large part, exactly why the show is so popular. Millions of viewers have made it the top reality show of all time because they reject the moral bankruptcy of other reality families. Indeed, the Robertsons' Christianity has been very profitable for A&E. The outrage over Phil's intolerance also seems blindly hypocritical. Many of his most indignant critics, including prominent voices in the media, are the very same people who are overtly intolerant and dismissive of Christians, regularly condemning them as idiots, fanatics and loons. A colleague of mine -- someone I like very much -- once said that parents who taught their children the creation story should be charged with child abuse. Another colleague of mine likened a Christian community in Florida to Jonestown. I've heard many others openly wish that anti-abortion Christians had been aborted. This is the kind of tolerance to which Phil Robertson should aspire? A&E need not endorse Phil's comments, nor must we embrace them. But it's unfortunate that an otherwise kind and giving family has been maligned for expressing personal views shared by many. Reject those views, but do not reject this family. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E.

A man frantically bounds from roof-to-roof, running from a pack of blood-thirsty zombies. Thankfully, this is not the apocalypse, but a white-knuckle point-of-view video, featuring a Parkour athlete dramatically scaling walls and leaping between buildings. Inspired by the highly-anticipated action survival game, Dying Light, the video is shot from the point-of-view of a Parkour athlete, charting his frantic escape from zombies, over the rooftops of Cambridge. Its director, Scott Bass, 23,  told MailOnline: 'I wanted to have something that took the viewer on a whirlwind parkour experience, but finish in a way that felt true to the tone of the game. The video is shot from the point-of-view of a parkour runner, charting his frantic escape from zombies . No injuries occured while filming the Parkour scences - but there was an incident when one cast member was eating while walking down the stairs . 'I’ve been involved in Parkour since 2005, and pursuing it professionally since 2010. I usually work as a director for films involving parkour, but also as photographer and consultant from time to time.' The dramatic video was shot over three days in the director's home town. Bass explained: 'Collectively, I felt we all knew Cambridge best for this film. Its the closest looking city to the game I could think of, and I had a lot of confidence in scouting out locations that I knew we could work with.' 'We had to battle the weather and light a bit, as we shot last november. We had quite a lot of rain during the shoot, and you can see plenty of puddles in the film because of this.' Well-known Parkour athlete Toby Segar stars as the hero, who is chased through the streets of Cambridge . Frantic chase: The video's director, Scott Bass, has been involved in Parkour since 2005 . Hands off: In a dramatic moment, one of the video's blood-thirsty zombies grabs the hero's crotch . 'We had Toby Segar as the hero zombie, and Alex Potts, Phil Doyle and Neil Cointet rounded out my zombie cast. They’re all very talented and well known Parkour athletes, so I had a bit of an all-star crew really.' 'I think my favourite moment is around 2:15, where the zombie jumps at the hero and grabs at his… crotch. It was planned the zombie would grab at the hero, but it just happened to be that he grabbed there. 'I actually liked the authenticity of the take and knew it would be something that viewers would want to comment on, so I left it in. 'We had one small injury where one of the guys was eating while walking down stairs during a location move, but nothing from parkour! These guys are so highly trained in their movement, its always the little things that get them.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Incredible video shows frantic escape over Cambridge rooftops .\\nMade by a team of film makers who specialise in gravity-defying Parkour .\\nFearless hero leaps between buildings and scales walls .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Ian Parker, Press Association . Niki Lauda has questioned the wisdom of Flavio Briatore's return to Formula One as the potential head of a group designed to increase the sport's popularity. Briatore is the former Renault team principal forced out of F1 for his involvement in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix 'crashgate' saga, resigning from his post the following September. The Italian has rarely visited the paddock since, but was the name mentioned during a meeting between F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and the team principals during the recent race weekend in Hungary as they sought ways to improve the show given the decline in audiences. Mercedes: The German manufacturer's non-executive chairman says Briatore should not return . Crash-gate: Flavio Briatore resigned from his role in Formula One after becoming embroiled in scandal . Three-time champion Lauda, who currently serves as Mercedes' non-executive chairman, has been left bemused by the links surrounding Briatore. 'Why do we need Flavio?' said Lauda. 'Bernie is the man in charge, and he should stay in charge. We should think together with Bernie as he is the master of what we can improve.' It is understood Ecclestone was initially supportive of the idea, but has seemingly backtracked on the suggestion. Speaking to German publication Auto Motor und Sport, Ecclestone said: 'We do not need Flavio. We can do it ourselves.' Regardless of whether or not Briatore is involved, it is understood F1 is pushing ahead with a plan to set up the 'popularity working group'. CEO: Bernie Ecclestone should remain in charge of Formula One, says Mercedes' Niki Lauda . Renault: Briatore talking to Nelson Piquet when the two both worked for Renault's F1 team .

It is believed the popularity taskforce is to include Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya.

Nearly all of Britain's troops in Iraq will have left by the week's end. The withdrawal marks the first time since the invasion of Iraq more than six years ago that there will be almost no British troops in the country. The only British troops there will be a group of about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission, the ministry said. The United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN. He declined to be named in line with policy. \"The small handful of British military personnel operating in Iraq will be withdrawn to Kuwait after Iraq's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay,\" the spokesman said. Iraq must give its permission for foreign troops to be on its soil. It was a group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on British troops. They walked out of parliament as a group on July 11, depriving the legislature of the minimum number of lawmakers necessary for votes to take place. Parliament is now on summer recess until September 8. Fawzi Akram, a lawmaker from the Sadr bloc, confirmed that the bloc reject the Iraqi-British security agreement. He said that Iraq does not need the British troops and that Iraqi security forces are ready to handle security on their own. Britain hopes the Iraqi parliament will eventually approve the security agreement. \"While this delay is unfortunate, we are continuing to seek a solution with the Iraqi Government that will provide our forces with the sound legal basis they need,\" the ministry said in a written statement. The British troops who are being pulled out include Royal Navy servicemen who have been helping the Iraqis to protect oil fields around the port town of Umm Qasr, according to the Ministry of Defence spokesman. All British combat troops have already left the country, another ministry spokesman told CNN. There were about 46,000 British troops in and around Iraq at the peak of major combat operations in March and April 2003, according to the Ministry of Defence. CNN's Jonathan Wald in London and Youssif Basil in Baghdad, Iraq, contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Almost all British troops in Iraq are being pulled out .\\nAgreement that allows them to be there expires on Friday .\\nOnly about dozen British troops will remain to help train Iraqi police .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:59 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:41 EST, 20 November 2012 . Rock carvings held sacred to an American Indian tribe in California's Sierra Nevada for thousands of years have fallen prey to modern thieves armed with power saws. At least four petroglyphs - some 2 feet wide and located 15 feet above the ground - were hacked from lava cliffs in the Eastern Sierra. Visitors to the area, known as Volcanic Tableland, discovered the theft and reported it to the federal Bureau of Land Management on October 31. Sacred: Rock carvings that graced an American Indian site in California's Sierra Nevada for thousands of years have fallen victim to thieves armed with power saws . Ancient writings: Raymond Andrews, the tribal historic preservation officer of the Bishop Paiute Tribe visits area that hosts petroglyphs etched more than 3,000 years ago into the volcanic cliff faces . 'This was the worst act of vandalism ever seen' on the 750,000 acres of public land administered by the BLM field office in Bishop, BLM archaeologist Greg Haverstock told the Los Angeles Times. The thieves must have used ladders, electric generators and power saws. In addition to the four carvings that were stolen, one was defaced with deep saw cuts on three sides, and another was removed but apparently broke during the theft and was left propped against a boulder near a visitor parking lot. More than 3,500 years ago, Native Americans carved pictures of hunters, deer and other animals, and geometric and other designs into a half-mile-long volcanic escarpment. Theft: The drawings have apparently been taken by bold thieves armed with ladders, power saws and other equipment . The images adorn hundreds of lava boulders. The petroglyphs are probably worth only about $500 to $1,500 on the illegal art market but are priceless to American Indians, authorities said. 'We still use this sacred place as a kind of church to educate tribal members and children about our historical and spiritual connections,' Paiute tribal historic preservation officer Raymond Andrews said. 'So, our tribal elders are appalled by what happened here.' Value: The petroglyphs are probably worth only about $500 to $1,500 on the illegal art market but are priceless to American Indians . Volunteers have stepped up surveillance at the site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The BLM is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to arrests.

Daniel Miller . Last updated at 10:36 AM on 15th November 2011 . Contentious: Tennessee Republican Rick Womick claims all Muslims should be forced out of the U.S. military . A Republican politician has sparked religious fury by demanding all Muslims be forced out of the U.S. military. Tennessee State Representative Rick Womick claimed serving Muslims posed a significant threat and needed to be kicked out of the armed forces because their religion commands them to lie. Interviewed on Veteran's Day by the Think Progress website he said: 'Personally I don't trust one Muslim in our military because they're commanded to lie to us. 'And if they really are a devout Muslim and follow the Koran and the and the Sunnah, then I feel threatened because they're commanded to kill me.' Mr Womick was attending the 'Preserving Freedom Conference hosted by the controversial group, the Sharia Awareness Action Network. Asked if he felt that serving Muslims should be 'forced out' he replied: 'Absolutely yes.' He later reasserted his opinions in an interview with the Murfreesboro Daily News adding: 'Who are we at war with? 'We are at war with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who are Muslims. It's a Catch-22. They are not allowed to kill their fellow Muslims, we're at war with Muslims. 'The only solution I see is that they not be allowed in the military.' Womick, a Baptist and member of the National Rifle Association, served as a pilot in the Air Firce during the first Gulf War. The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) demanded the Tennessee General Assembly rebuke Womick for his comments. But he described them as a 'radical Islamic group'. Duty: There are an estimated 3500 Muslims serving within the U.S. armed forces . He added: 'Whatever they have to say, I choose to ignore.' Saleh Sbenaty of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro told the Tenneseean: 'It's really sad to see Mr. Womick's comments coming on Veterans Day,' said Sbenaty. 'He needs to be reminded that there are thousands of Muslims who serve and are serving (in the U.S. military), and there are many of them who gave up their lives to preserve the freedom of this country and the freedom that he is enjoying.' There are an estimated six million Muslims living in the U.S. with around 3500 serving the military and many seeing action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Sbenaty added: 'Al-Qaida doesn't believe in freedom of religion. 'They want to rule the world according to their views. And Mr. Womick wants to rule the United States according to his narrow vision.' In 2009 13 people were killed at Fort Hood in Texas after a Muslim officer allegedly went on a rampage yelling 'Allahu Akbar', weeks before he was due to serve in Afghanistan. Major Nidal Malik Hasan has been charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder. He is due to stand trial in March 2012.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Politician sparks fury with Veteran's Day rant .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Robert Allenby overcame an ankle problem to claim a share of the lead after the first round of the Sony Open in Hawaii. The Australian suffered the injury after falling of a curb in Honolulu earlier this week, but still managed to fire a five-under-par 65 in his first PGA Tour appearance of 2010. He was joined at the top of the leaderboard by five other players despite windy conditions at the Waialae Country Club on Thursday. His score was matched by former Masters champion Zach Johnson, Davis Love III, John Merrick, Ryan Palmer and PGA Tour Qualifying School winner Troy Merritt. They were one shot ahead of a group of 10 players including current Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina, world No. 3 Steve Stricker, Sweden's Carl Pettersson and former U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman. \"I twisted my ankle on Monday and didn't know whether I was going to play, tried it out yesterday and sort of scraped it around the golf course,\" Allenby told reporters. \"I kind of did the same things today really. It's all a bit abbreviated, the old swing, but the short game's good and that's what counts. You need that when you're not 100 percent.\" British Open champion Stewart Cink was further back in another big group of 11 tied on two-under along with South Africa's Rory Sabbatini and Japan's Ryuichi Oda. Former world No. 1s Ernie Els and Vijay Singh were among those another stroke back alongside two-time major winner Retief Goosen. Meanwhile, David Lynn is set to take a one-stroke lead into the third round of the European Tour's Joburg Open in South Africa after Friday's action was halted by bad weather with 30 players still out on the course. The Englishman, who has won only once in more than 300 starts, followed up his opening 63 with a four-under-par 67 at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington East. He was five shots clear of compatriot John Parry and South Africa's Andrew Curlewis, who were the highest placed of those yet to complete their rounds, each with three holes to go. Home favorite Charl Schwartzel, also one of four players to score 63 in the first round, was second on 11-under after a 68. Irishman Darren Clarke, seeking to regain his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team this year, was tied for third on 10-under after a 69.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Robert Allenby overcomes ankle injury to claim share of lead after first round of Sony Open .\\nAustralian cards five-under-par 65 in in his first PGA Tour appearance of 2010 .\\nHe is matched by Zach Johnson, Davis Love, John Merrick, Ryan Palmer, Troy Merritt .\\nDavid Lynn has one-stroke lead as weather hits second round of European Tour's Joburg Open .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- It was one of those oh-by-the-way moments -- an afterthought really. It wasn't supposed to be a coming out party. Sure, the subject matter was serious, but in the end the mood was lighthearted. Lawmakers gathered in the Pennsylvania state capital in Harrisburg on Tuesday to propose a major change in the state's hate crime law to extend protection to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Lawmakers made their pitch for getting the legislation to the governor's desk by the end of the year. Then bill sponsor, Sen. Jim Ferlo of Pittsburgh, made his surprise announcement -- very casually. \"Hundreds of people know I'm gay. I just never made an official declaration,\" he said. \"I never felt I had to wear a billboard on my forehead. But I'm gay. Get over it. I love it. It's a great life.\" The announcement capped a momentous day for the LGBT community. Earlier, charges were filed against three people in the recent beating of a gay couple in Philadelphia. All are charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and criminal conspiracy, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. They could not be charged with a hate crime for the same reason lawmakers held their news conference -- people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are not covered under Pennsylvania's hate crime law. Kevin J. Harrigan, 26, Kathryn G. Knott, 24, and Phillip Williams, 24, surrendered to police on Wednesday, according to WPVI. Later, Ferlo, who will be leaving the state Senate in November, said his remarks weren't planned. \"It was totally impromptu. I've never denied it.

The 1,527-foot-tall BREN tower was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River. It was also the tallest structure of its kind ever demolished, according to the National Nuclear Safety Administration. The tower stood taller than the Empire State Building (1,454 feet) and the Eiffel Tower (1,063 feet). It was also taller than the iconic Stratosphere (1,148 feet) on the Las Vegas strip. Originally constructed in 1962, the BREN Tower took its name from the nuclear radiation experiment for which it was built: Bare Reactor Experiment - Nevada. BREN Tower was designed to provide a way for scientists to accurately estimate radiation doses received by survivors of the atomic bombs detonated over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The tower stood 1,527 feet tall because that was the height at which \"Little Boy,\" the first atomic bomb used in warfare, was detonated over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. To conduct research at the time, engineers mounted a small unshielded (bare) reactor on the tower and built a mock Japanese village near the base of the tower. The mock village was intended to simulate the shielding effects that rooftops and walls had on radiation, according to Dante Pistone, public affairs manager for the Nevada National Security Site. Scientists used the research to estimate radiation doses residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were subjected to when the bomb detonated. According to the Nevada National Security Site, the data became a cornerstone of modern radiation research. The tower stood in a rural area about 65 miles north of Las Vegas on the Nevada National Security Site. The enormous proving ground is larger than the state of Rhode Island. In 1992 the U.S. government stopped full-scale nuclear testing on the site. Despite its height, in 1966 the U.S. government decided to move the tower to a different location at a cost of $380,000. The move was made so scientists could conduct further experiments using BREN Tower while not disrupting underground nuclear testing in the area, according to the Nevada National Security Site. Last used for research in 1999, in recent years the tower fell into disrepair. The beacons used to alert commercial aviation at the top of the tower had failed, and the elevator used by workers to ascend to the top was no longer safely reliable. It would have cost close to $1 million to repair the tower to its original state. Wednesday's demolition cost about half of what it would have cost to repair the tower.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"BREN was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River .\\nTower was used to estimate radiation doses received by WWII nuke survivors .\\nBREN was last used for research in 1999 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The million-dollar questions have been answered. What are the Powerball numbers, and have any winning tickets been sold? Lottery officials released the winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot: 22, 10,13,14, 52, and the Powerball number is 11. One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. Saturday's jackpot is a record $590.5 million. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The jackpot has a cash value of $376.9 million. \"I buy mine here all the time. Yesterday, I was in Naples. I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck,\" Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills. \"I just hope whoever won really needs the money, and I hope they do right by it,\" he said. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to $925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. Why you keep playing the lottery . Hate to break it to you, but you stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning the jackpot. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's $587 million Powerball drawing. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. At a convenience store in Riverside, Missouri, Jim Mansell said he was buying only one ticket. \"I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket,\" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. \"But I don't know if the good Lord believes in gambling or not.\" In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing. Any Powerball retailer in the state can validate a winning ticket.

Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 06:26 EST, 7 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:35 EST, 7 August 2012 . A colourful, fruit-eating bird with a black mask, pale belly and scarlet breast has been discovered and named following an expedition to the remote Peruvian Andes. The Sira Barbet, or Capito fitzpatricki, is described by Cornell University graduates in a paper published . in the July 2012 issue of The Auk, the official publication of the . American Ornithologists' Union. The team discovered the barbet on a ridge of mountainous cloud forest in the Cerros del Sira range in the eastern Andes. The Sira Barbet, Capito fitzpatricki, has been discovered and named by Cornell University graduates following an expedition to the remote Peruvian Andes . The new species was discovered during a . 2008 expedition led by Michael G. Harvey, Glenn Seeholzer and Ben . Winger, young ornithologists who had recently graduated from Cornell. Steep ridges and deep river gorges in the Andes produce many isolated habitats and microclimates that give rise to uniquely evolved species. Though clearly a sister species of the Scarlet-banded Barbet, the Sira Barbet is readily distinguished by differences in color on the bird's flanks, lower back and thighs, and a wider, darker scarlet breast band. Machu Picchu in Peru: The unique terrain of the surrounding area leads to a diverse range of species . By comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences of the new barbet to DNA sequences of its close relatives in the genus Capito, the team secured genetic evidence that this is a new species in the barbet family. The genetic work was done by co-author Jason Weckstein at The Field Museum in Chicago. The team chose the scientific name, Capito fitzpatricki, in honor of Cornell Lab of Ornithology executive director John W. Fitzpatrick, who discovered and named seven new bird species in Peru during the 1970s and '80s. Winger said: 'Fitz has inspired generations of young ornithologists in scientific discovery and conservation. 'He was behind us all the way when we presented our plan for this expedition.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Species Capito fitzpatricki named after Cornell director who discovered new species in the 1970s and 1980s .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Ecuador's Tungurahua volcano erupted Saturday, sending ash and lava spewing nearly a mile into the sky. Residents evacuated the area after the country's National Agency of Risk Control issued a \"red alert.\" The warning was later downgraded to orange, as the volcano became less active. Activity at Tungurahua -- which means \"throat of fire\" in the native Quechua language -- peaked Saturday between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., according to the Geological Institute in Quito. At one point, the ash cloud reached nearly 3 km (1.9 miles) above the volcano's crater, according to the institute, and lava flowed about 2 km from the crater. The glacier-capped, 16,478-foot (5,023-meter) volcano has erupted periodically since 1999, when increased activity led to the temporary evacuation of the city of Banos at the foot of the volcano. Major eruptions also occurred in August 2006 and February 2008, according to the government's emergency management agency. Prior to this more recent activity, the last major eruption was between 1916 and 1918. Relatively minor activity continued until 1925, the Smithsonian Institution said on its volcano website. The volcano is 140 km south of Quito, Ecuador's capital.

So for half an hour every day, these employees at a plant in Guangdong are allowed to settle back in their spring-back chairs and grab some precious shut-eye. Sitting in a chair might not be the most relaxed way of dropping off to sleep, as shown in this photo, but this is a vast improvement from years gone by when slumbering at the work desk was treated as a cardinal sin and often meant instant dismissal. Hard at rest: Chinese electronics factory workers still wearing their protective clothing take their officially-sanctioned post-lunch naps . Granting official permission for workers to enjoy an apres-lunch nap at their benches is all part of reforms that have been implemented in recent years - and factories are reaping the benefits in increased productivity. The ‘sleeping on the job’ rule has benefited workers so much that the Chinese government now happily reveals that there has been a 30 per cent increase in work flow since it came about, combined with the introduction of a 40-hour working week, a drop in eight hours. This picture was taken by photographer Zhan Youbing who is well qualified to understand why even grabbing a nap in a chair is a matter of great comfort - for he is a former employee from a number of factories producing toys and electronic products. Later learning photographic skills, he embarked on a project to observe what he says is the evolution of the manufacturing world, taking more than 40,000 photos revealing the various conditions his comrades were working under. He recalls how, in 1995 at the age of 22, he arrived in the city of Guangdong along with many young Chinese from the villages seeking work in the burgeoning export-oriented industry. The factories chose workers aged between 18 and 25 because the conditions were demanding - 15 hour shifts six or seven days a week with only short breaks for as little as 34p an hour. The workers receiving the on-the-clock naps are based in Dongguan (pictured), in China's Guangdong Province . But since 2005 there have been vast improvements in working conditions, with salary increases, dormitories being provided for workers who prefer to grab a nap lying down, renovated dining halls and leisure areas where workers can play table tennis or simply relax. Some factories have even helped to provide the children of their workers with education and make clean drinking water available to them. But in an increasing number of factories these days, the greatest torture - sleep deprivation - is becoming a thing of the past. Well-rested workers are happy workers, bosses are now agreeing.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Chinese factory employees allowed a 30 minute nap every day after lunch .\\nGovernment claims napping rule has boosted productivity by 30 per cent .\\nIt is one of many rules to have vastly improved factory working conditions .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA young filmmaker has remade one of the most successful movies ever - Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark - by putting his family puppy in the starring role. Zach King, 23, from Portland, Oregon, used his Boxer puppy Indy to create a short homage to Steven Spielberg's action classic called Indiana Bones and the Raiders of the Lost Bark. The five minute film recreates famous scenes from the original movie, including when Harrison Ford's character uses his whip to swing across a gap and also the moment he rescues his hat from under a closing door. It also features Indiana Bones running to escape a giant rolling boulder. But rather than facing evil Nazi soldiers looking for world domination, the canine Indy has to face a rather cuter enemy - kittens. It is the latest in a number of animal based remakes that Mr King has produced including Jedi Kittens and Jedi Kittens Strike Back. Mr King said it took him and his friend Jadon Gauthier several days to film the Indiana Bones film, which charts the puppy searching for his lost bark. They created outfits and props for the animals out of pieces of cardboard. Writing on his YouTube channel FinalCutKing, he said: 'This video was created with 3 rolls of duct tape, 108 glue sticks, 18 large boxes of cardboard, a few all nighters with an adorable puppy.' Mr King has even had a special film poster by artist Josh Kenfield made to go along with the movie. Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, directed by Stephen Spielberg in 1981, is one of the highest grossing movies ever made and won five Oscars. Zach King's puppy Indy took the starring role played by Harrison Ford in his short Indiana Jones remake . The original Indiana Jones films starred Harrison Ford in the lead role as the whip cracking archaeologist and were some of the most successful action movies ever made by combining comedy, fantasy and adventure . Artist Josh Kenfield produced a movie poster based on the original to go with the spoof Indiana Bones film . He is already well known on Vine for his cleverly edited six second videos that appear to show him doing impossible magic tricks. A cinema and media arts graduate he won YouTube's NextUp Creators Contest in 2013. Earlier this year Mr King told the Independent that he would like to move on from short films to one day direct his own action adventure feature film. He said: 'Someday I would love to direct feature films – action-adventure titles would be the dream genre to produce. 'But I'm loving being an online content creator right now and I have a large audience so I want to keep creating content for them.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The five minute film was created by Zach King using his Boxer puppy Indy .\\nMr King and his friends spent days recreating scenes from the hit movie .\\nThey used cardboard, glue and Duct tape to create costumes and props .\\nThe  villains, which were Nazis in the original movie, are played by kittens .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to taking part in the 2013 Boston bombings. He could face the death penalty . Attorneys for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday denied as 'false' and 'preposterous' an allegation that defense team members posed as FBI employees while investigating the case in Russia. 'Let us be clear: at no time have members of the defense team misrepresented themselves or lied about their work,' the defense attorneys said in a court filing. They also said trying to get information in a country where people are suspicious of appointed defense lawyers, the defense team already has a difficult job persuading potential witnesses it is working to protect Tsarnaev 'rather than facilitating the U.S. government's effort to execute him'. Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to participating with his now-deceased brother Tamerlan in the 2013 bombings that killed three people and injured about 260 others. He could face the death penalty. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen who came to the Boston area with his family more than a decade ago. His parents have returned to Russia. Prosecutors said the allegation came in an official communication from the Russian government, which expelled the three individuals. Prosecutors cited it in a court filing on Friday opposing a defense request to delay Tsarnaev's November 3 trial, saying the preparation work load cited by the defense is largely self-inflicted. Defense attorneys said that by repeating 'reckless allegations' prosecutors are likely making it more difficult for them to prepare on time. They pleaded again for a delay. 'More time is needed to ensure basic fairness to the accused. It is also needed to service society's best interest in the fullest possible accounting of what happened in Boston during the week of April 15, 2013, and why it happened,' the lawyers said. Prosecutors noted in their legal brief that three members of Tsarnaev's legal team were recently expelled from Russia after misrepresenting themselves as tourists to local authorities. 'While conducting interviews in Russia, the members of the defense team reportedly refused to produce documents confirming their legal status and identified themselves as employees of the FBI,' the brief states. 'As a result, the Russian government found that the defense team members had violated the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation and expelled them.' Two explosions went off near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 leaving three people dead .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense team has found it difficult to convince potential witnesses it is working to protect Tsarnaev .\\nTsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to participating with his now-deceased brother Tamerlan in the 2013 bombings that killed three people .\\nProsecutors said the allegation came in an official communication from the Russian government, which expelled the three individuals .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAtlanta (CNN) -- Natina Reed, one-third of the early 2000s R&B trio Blaque, was struck by a vehicle and killed Friday night in Georgia, Gwinnett County police said Saturday. Reed, 32, was walking in traffic on a major roadway just north of the metro Atlanta city of Lilburn \"for some unknown reason\" when she was struck around 10:30 p.m., according to Gwinnett police spokesman Sgt. Rich Long. The driver of the vehicle, who was not charged in the incident, called 911 while the passenger administered CPR. Reed was pronounced dead at Gwinnett Medical Center. Blaque, best known for the 2000 hit \"Bring it All to Me,\" was discovered by TLC's Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes. The group's self-titled album debuted in 1999. Lopes herself died in a 2002 car accident in Honduras. Fellow Blaque members Shamari Devoe and Brandi Williams took to Twitter on Saturday to remember Reed. \"My world as I know it has forever changed. Until we meet again, may you find comfort in the arms of an angel. I love you Natina,\" Devoe tweeted. Reed also appeared in the 2000 movie \"Bring it On\" as Jenelope, a feisty cheerleader from East Compton. Her co-star, Gabrielle Union, also tweeted about her death Saturday, posting \"#RIP #Sad #BringItOn.\" Reed is survived by her 10-year-old son, Tren.

Illinois State Police say they are looking into the death of Mayor Tim Davlin, and no cause of death was disclosed Tuesday. Frank Kunz, a Springfield alderman who serves as mayor pro tem, said investigators \"didn't say much of anything\" at a news conference held shortly after Davlin was found dead in his home. \"Basically, what they confirmed was, it was the mayor, and he's dead,\" Kunz said. \"They actually didn't say much of anything.\" The 53-year-old, two-term Democrat was scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday morning and account for the balance of his cousin's $845,000 estate, for which he served as executor. Margaret Ettelbrick, who died in 2003, had willed the remainder of her estate to Springfield Catholic Charities after leaving $635,000 to other beneficiaries, court documents show. In May, Catholic Charities told the court it had received only a partial payment of $25,000. The same month, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien against Davlin's home, seeking nearly $90,000 in back taxes from 2003, 2005 and 2006, according to property records. In September, Davlin's lawyer quit, telling the court that the mayor had not provided him with the needed paperwork to account for the balance of the estate. Davlin told the judge last week that he had hired a new attorney, and he was ordered to report back to court Tuesday. In November, Davlin announced that he would not seek a third term in 2011. Kunz said the city of about 115,000 was \"stunned\" by news of his death. \"Even when they had a press conference, they weren't sure all the relatives had been notified,\" he said. \"But he was the mayor, so they had to do something.\" Kunz said city council members would name a new mayor at some point, but officials were still examining the laws governing mayoral succession. The city's administrative staff remains intact, and \"If they had to sign anything, I can sign it,\" he said. Davlin was divorced and had four children. Police were called to his home about 8:50 a.m. and found the mayor \"unresponsive,\" Springfield Police Chief Robert Williams said. He was declared dead soon afterward, and the investigation was turned over to state police, he said. \"It's very early,\" Illinois State Police Capt. James Wolf said. \"And as information develops and we are in a position to provide the media with more information, we will do so.\" CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The mayor was found dead in his home Tuesday morning .\\nAlderman says Springfield was \\\"stunned\\\" by the news .\\nDavlin had been ordered into court in an estate lawsuit .\\nThe IRS had also placed a lien on his home for unpaid taxes .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN Student News) -- August 12, 2014 .

Chilli and T-Boz were closely involved from start to finish in developing the script, casting and preparing the actors, Chilli said. \"This is our baby.\" T-Boz brings reality to TV . Actress-singer Keke Palmer plays Chilli, rapper Lil' Mama portrays Left Eye and Drew Sidora is T-Boz. \"We basically took them under our wings and we shared a lot of stories with them,\" Chilli said. \"We spent a lot of time with them, and they were very observant when it came to looking at how Tionne and I interact with each other, the chemistry that we naturally have.\" \"We spent more time with Lil' Mama, since Lisa was not here,\" Chilli said. \"So we really had to spend more time with her. She looked at a lot of video footage. She did a lot of research.\" The film includes sequences with Lil' Mama that closely echo the VH-1 documentary \"Last Days of Left Eye.\" \"We're really proud with how she portrayed Lisa, and I know Lisa would be very happy and I know her family would be very happy as well,\" Chilli said. Lil' Mama may join TLC . Lil' Mama may be on stage singing Left Eye's parts when TLC tours to promote a new album set for release next year, they said. \"For sure, we're talking and thinking about it when we go on tour,\" Chilli said. She performed with Chilli and T-Boz this summer several times, including at Drake's OVO Festival in Toronto. The group is keeping details about next year's album -- their first in a decade -- a secret, other than to say it will have a lot of featured artists, including Lady Gaga. \"We have some other surprises,\" Chilli said. Fans can already hear a new TLC single -- \"Meant to Be\" -- that they recorded with Ne-Yo. It was released this week as part of the soundtrack album for the movie. The ballad \"kind of sums up our 20-year span as a group,\" Chilli said. \"It will definitely pull on your heartstrings,\" said T-Boz.

I'm not his doctor. I'm a facial plastic surgeon. \"When I spoke to Charlie it sounded like he was in a lot of pain, severe pain, so when someone's in severe pain you know it's not like I'm going to walk out my door and go see him. Plus I don't even live that close next to him,\" Nassif said. \"When I usually hear something like that -- you don't know what's going on -- so the thing you always are going to do is dial 911. \"I instructed the person I was speaking with to call 911 and then I also followed up to make sure that it was performed and kind of communicated somewhat to the paramedics,\" Nassif said. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse in his Los Angeles home. Sheen has since entered rehab, and his hit sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\" has suspended production. Nassif couldn't determine whether Sheen was drunk or high. \"I couldn't tell if he was inebriated. I only spoke to him for a very brief moment because as soon as I heard him say he's in a lot of pain I wanted to get on the phone with the assistant so they can just immediately dial 911,\" Nassif said. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\" \"They wanted to get married, and a mutual friend introduced all of us, and they said, 'Let's get married, can we get married at your house?' and that's how we met and soon after that we became very good friends,\" Nassif said. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation. \"There were things he said I don't feel comfortable\" disclosing, Nassif said. At another point in the interview, Nassif added: \"Obviously we all want Charlie to keep his sobriety. No one can push him into it.\" Sheen's manager has said the actor is undergoing rehab at home, not in a residential facility. \"Where you do it doesn't matter if you have someone with you that's helping you,\" Nassif said. \"That would be nice to be at your own environment as long as you have the right structure.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Plastic surgeon says he was groggy when he got call .\\nSheen tells friend he's in pain .\\nSurgeon tells Sheen's assistant to dial 911 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nPassengers on a whale watching trip in California were treated to the sight of a rare white dolphin Sunday.

He added that Venezuela should diversify its investments, placing more of its reserves in countries such as Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa. \"The time has come. The economies of Europe and the United States are sinking. Now we must see that the economies of China, Russia and Brazil are more solid,\" he said. Venezuelan leaders did not specify when they would begin bringing back gold reserves. \"'We want to protect our assets that belong to the Venezuelan people,\" said Nelson Merentes, president of Central Bank of Venezuela, according to the state-run AVN news agency. \"We are going to do it gradually, using a technique used worldwide to bring the gold, because they are physical bars that were deposited and we must certify that they are the same ones.\" Chavez detailed the gold reserves plan hours after announcing that he planned to issue a decree that will permit the takeover of a gold-rich area in southern Venezuela, according to AVN. Chavez said that the nationalization was necessary \"because in that area there is anarchy, there are mafias, smugglers.\" Venezuela has as much as $12 billion in gold reserves, Chavez said, and \"we cannot permit them to keep taking that from us.\" The Venezuelan leader said the moves would bring more money and stability to Venezuela.

The lethargic creature doesn't look capable of much monkey business, although keepers at his Indonesian zoo maintain he is a healthy weight. Udel, who is also seen here clumsily hauling his gigantic body through a pool of water, is just 3ft 11in tall and tips the scales at a whopping 15st 10lbs.

'Everyone there was amazed by his size. 'At first I thought he must be so big because visitors to the zoo throw food and snacks to him - he even had a wrapper stuck to the side of his face. 'But according to the zoo he's actually a normal weight for its age.' Adult male orangutans can grow to 5ft 9in and a weight of about 19st. Udel is apparently still active and able to climb and swing with the other primates - although he looks rather sedentary in these pictures. Hendy said: 'He's definitely the biggest monkey I've ever seen. 'At 7am, the zoo feeds Udel with fruits. Then at 2pm they gave him fresh milk, and then at 4pm they gave him more fruits. 'As far as I know there are no plans to put it on any sort of diet. He had space of more than 100 square meters. 'Apparently he is still active and can move around, climb and hang on to a rope.'

The people were all evicted for the practice known as 'courtsiding', New Zealand Police said in a statement. Courtsiding involves people at a game relaying information via smartphones or mobile communications devices to gambling syndicates to take advantage of broadcasting time delays. New Zealand won their opening game of the cricket World Cup by 98 runs against Sri Lanka . Corey Anderson blasted 75 off of only 46 balls as the co-hosts begun the tournament with a victory . The practice is different from match-fixing, which was made illegal under New Zealand's Crimes Act last year, where a pre-determined outcome has been assured. Local media had reported witnessing several people being escorted out of the ground in Christchurch and police later said they had been in breach of the ticketing regulations under suspicion of the practice.

President Obama made veterans' affairs a big priority in the 2008 campaign and continues to do so. The joint virtual lifetime electronic record will, among other things, help ensure a streamlined transition of health care records between the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration. It will provide \"a framework to ensure that all health care providers have all the information they need to deliver high-quality health care while reducing medical errors,\" the White House said in a background statement. \"When a member of the armed forces separates from the military, he or she will no longer have to walk paperwork from a [Defense Department] duty station to a local VA health center. Their electronic records will transition along with them and remain with them forever,\" Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House. The system will \"cut through red tape\" and allow new veterans to start receiving their benefits more quickly, he promised. During the announcement, Obama was joined by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. \"We welcome this news. ... This is a huge day for veterans and troops,\" Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN. \"This is a good way for [Obama] to come back from Iraq and make a powerful statement.\" The White House recently proposed a significant budget increase for the Veterans Administration, including an 11 percent hike in fiscal year 2010. In March, however, the administration abandoned a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments. Veterans' representatives and members of Congress angrily opposed the proposal, which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"NEW: \\\"This is a huge day for veterans and troops,\\\" chief of veterans group says .\\nGovernment is establishing a new system for updating medical records .\\nJoint virtual lifetime electronic record aims to streamline data between Pentagon, VA .\\nObama: System will \\\"cut through red tape,\\\" allow new vets to get benefits faster .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAn Afghanistan soldier and his nine-year-old daughter were reunited for the first time after a year on Thursday when she threw the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game where he was disguised as the catcher.

He stood up with the ball and peeled off his mask, causing his delighted daughter to run and leap into his arms just in front of the home plate. The crowd cheered as the delighted little girl beamed over her dad's shoulder. 'For a second, I felt like it was a dream,' she said.

A warning is in effect until 8 p.m. local time, fire officials said, with temperatures expected to be in the 90s and wind gusts of up to 50 mph. The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, and has burned more than 55,000 acres so far. It is about 45% contained. More than 1,600 firefighters were battling the blaze. It has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. \"The assessment is still under way and this number will continue to grow,\" the statement said. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. \"It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service. Vilsack toured the Colorado blaze and said it is one of thousands burning nationwide. The National Weather Service has issued warnings of high chances of wildfire activity in nine states, including Colorado. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said a tree struck by lightning about a week ago sparked the mammoth blaze in his state. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,600-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze is 30% contained. Meanwhile Sunday, a new fire broke out and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 290,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. Hundreds of firefighters from across the United States are helping local departments battle the blaze. Inciweb reports 303 personnel on site. The blaze was 75% contained as of Sunday.

Harrison, New York, Police Capt. Anthony Marraccini revealed at a news conference Monday that evidence extracted from the wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression as the car headed toward a stone wall. Rather, the accelerator was pressed 100 percent, authorities said. Marraccini said the data, which he described as \"black and white,\" was collected in a cooperative effort between Harrison police, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Toyota. \"Toyota has been very cooperative,\" said Marraccini. \"There's no possibility of any distortion of this data,\" he continued. \"These are the facts that surround this.\" A housekeeper was driving the car at the time of the accident. She told police the vehicle accelerated on its own as she eased forward down her employer's driveway, causing her to crash into a stone wall on the other side of the road. The incident, which did not involve other vehicles nor injuries to anyone, drew attention because the 2005 Prius was part of Toyota's November recall to address the risk of pedal entrapment in the floor mat. But police said early on that floor mats were not a factor in this accident. A recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the Prius. Monday's announcement corroborates a NHTSA statement from early in the investigation, explaining that \"information retrieved from the vehicle's onboard computer systems indicated there was no application of the brakes and the throttle was fully open.\" The statement suggested at the time that the driver may have been stepping on the accelerator, instead of the brake as she told police. \"We do see these accidents on occasion,\" Marraccini said Monday. \"I think with all this hype about Toyota, people are just looking to point fingers,\" he said. Marraccini said that he spoke with the housekeeper about the findings of the investigation, but she remains \"very passionate about her statement.\" \"When a driver believes they are on the brake pedal, they believe it. But there is no indication of that,\" Marraccini said. Toyota spokesman Wade Hoyt called the investigation \"thorough\" and \"conscientious,\" and praised authorities for their \"really outstanding piece of detective work.\" CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The wrecked 2005 Prius' data recorder showed no indication of brake compression.\\nPolice say there was no indication the driver engaged the brake.\\nPolice say the data was collected in a cooperative effort with NHTSA and Toyota.\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLuis Suarez could get his four-month ban for biting put on hold so he can play from the start of the season.

CAS could refuse but, if agreed, it could mean Suarez being available at the start of the domestic season, which is expected to be with Barcelona when the striker’s move from Liverpool is confirmed. The downside is that if the CAS agreed, Suarez would lose the close-season part of his ban and miss even more football if helost his appeal. That issue would be a key part of transfer discussions between Liverpool and Barcelona. Suarez’s ban was imposed on June 26 and as well as the four-match ban from all football activity, there was a nine-match international ban and a £66,000 fine. FIFA head of media Delia Fischer confirmed CAS could order the ban to be suspended while it dealt with the case. VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected . Bye bye: Luis Suarez will move to Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million deal . Decision: Suarez has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA . If Suarez wants to pursue the matter he has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA, after which he can lodge a further appeal with CAS. Barcelona have offered the £75million buy-out clause for Suarez and their club doctor has been sent to Uruguay to assess him before a medical. However, the doctor is also visiting Brazil first to check on Neymar’s cracked vertebrae. Barcelona are awaiting confirmation of Alexis Sanchez’s move to Arsenal before closing the deal with Liverpool but hope to unveil Suarez, 27, next week. Meanwhile, Liverpool plan talks and medical tests for Lazar Markovic on Friday before a £19.8m move from Benfica. New boy: Alexis Sanchez has completed his move from Barcelona to Arsenal, paving the way for Suarez . Anticipation: Futbolmania were already stocking 'Suarez 9' shirts ahead of his move to La Liga .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Luis Suarez could get biting ban put on hold .\\nUruguay star is considering an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .\\nSuarez will be able to start next season an appeal is successful .\\nLiverpool striker is expected to sign for Barcelona this week .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Same-sex marriage in Alaska can move forward after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected the state's request to delay enforcement. The one-sentence order from the justices denying a stay means gays and lesbians could soon legally wed. Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Wyoming did the same in that Western state. Barring any continued legal intervention, that would make Alaska and Wyoming the 30th and 31st states to allow same-sex marriage, up from 19 states at the beginning of the month. In Alaska, a federal judge in the state in recent days had ordered gays and lesbians be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period. But everything was on hold pending emergency action from the justices. Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted expedited waivers. Alaska had requested a stay, saying it needed more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage was being usurped by the courts. Officials, including the governor, had said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved was best for all Alaskans. But a number of same-sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in Nevada and Idaho as unconstitutional. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction also includes Alaska and other Western states. Wyoming officials have not indicated whether they will appeal the ruling from federal Judge Scott Skavdahl. The judge said it was preferable the voters or the legislature decide such matters as defining marriage, but concluded \"that ship has sailed.\" \"Binding precedent of [higher courts striking down similar bans] mandate this result, and this court will adhere to its constitutional duties and abide by the rule of law.\" A federal appeals court in June became the first such judicial body to strike down same-sex marriage, in Utah and Oklahoma. That court also has jurisdiction over appeals in Wyoming, known as the Equality State. The Supreme Court later allowed those federal rulings to stand. Gay and lesbian couples could begin marrying on October 23, sooner if the state decides to drop any plans to appeal. The Wyoming case is Guzzo v. Mead (14-cv-200). The Alaska case is high court case is Parnell v. Hamby (14A413).\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"NEW: Federal judge rules same-sex marriage is legal in Wyoming .\\nSupreme Court rejects Alaska's request to delay enforcement .\\nAlaska, Wyoming would become the 30th and 31st states to allow same-sex marriage .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nHe recently confirmed that his romance with Mollie King is back on and it isn't just David Gandy's personal life that's booming.

'It’s a special moment I will remember for a long time. 'The bench I was sitting on at the time is my favourite now, because of what happened.' The former music publisher, from Richmond, was visiting nearby Kew Gardens - a favourite haunt - to see jays, ringnecked parakeets and other garden birds. After the fox had polished off the onion rings, Mr Harris started to hand her peanuts meant for his feathered friends. His wife Sissel, 63, was on hand to capture the special moment on film.

The clown has thus far been known to hang out near train stations, in front of bank in broad daylight and behind trees at dusk, where he smiles and slowly waves at passersby while holding little balloons. While the clown hasn't broken any laws, he's caused a ruckus from Staten Islanders who can't help but associate it to the blood-thirsty killer clown of  Stephen King's It. Scroll down for video . Creepy: A mysterious clown has been terrifying residents of Staten Island since nearly two weeks ago . 'I'm driving home from the gym and this is what I see,' wrote Instagram user Robert Privitera with a particularly creepy shot of the yellow-clad clown. 'Guess who ain't sleeping tonight.' The haunting trickster first started cropping up on Staten Islanders' newsfeeds in the last week or two. Last Sunday, comedian Vic Dibitetto posted a video he took of the clown to Facebook. It shows the clown waving and pointing at drivers in broad daylight as they pass a TD Bank drivethru. 'Funny, how?' Dibitetto wondered. Scary either way: The clown's appearances, which are thus far unexplained, come at both night and during broad daylight . Boo! One man posted this photo of the clown as it waved from behind a tree in a residential area . While Dibitetto's experience was creepy, the clown appears to be at his scariest in the dark. Michael Leavy learned this the hard way. 'Ok so I'm a little freaked out right now. I was driving home from Buffalo Wild Wings and saw this waving at me,' wrote Leavy on Instagram after snapping the clown, which appeared from behind a tree. Vincent Innocente also saw the clown at night, near a train station waving to cars as he was caught by their high beams. 'He was just kinda standing there waving,' said the confused Innocente. The . reason behind the bizarre appearance of the Staten Island clown remains . unexplained, but if a similar story from across the Atlantic is any . indication, the man behind the white makeup is little more than a . prankster.

Mr Boyle said: 'Lucille passed away in the early hours of this morning following a traumatic brain haemorrhage.

A member of Prabowo's legal team said they plan to file a complaint against the election commission at the Constitutional Court on Friday. The court has until August 21 to make a ruling. His opponent, Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, won Indonesia's presidential race with 53% of the votes over Prabowo's 47%, the country's election commission announced on Tuesday. Hours before the release of the voting results from ballots cast on July 9, Prabowo criticized the election commission, citing what he called \"massive, structural and systematic cheating.\" In his speech carried live, he declared: \"We withdraw ourselves from the process.\" His statement drew confusion and uncertainty. But on Wednesday, his brother and business tycoon Hashim Djojohadikusumo said, \"Let me be clear, Prabowo never withdrew as a candidate for president.\" He said they would have accepted the results, whether the former lieutenant-general won or not, if they believed the vote count was fair. \"We continue to have grave concerns about the integrity of the electoral process in a number of provinces,\" his brother said. \"An estimated 52,000 polling stations have reported irregularities, putting an estimated 21 million votes in question. The indication of massive fraud and widespread irregularities is overwhelming.\" Congratulations for Jokowi . Meanwhile, congratulations from the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and other nations poured in for Indonesia's president-elect. Widely known as \"Jokowi,\" he has drawn comparisons to Barack Obama for his unlikely ascent, from growing up in humble origins to becoming a national politician. On Tuesday, he delivered a speech aboard a traditional Indonesian boat, calling for national unity in the world's most populous Muslim nation. \"I ask you to heal your relations within your family, with neighbor to neighbor and with friends that were once broken.\" The new president will be inaugurated on October 20.

Speaking at an event in Nice, Sarkozy vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration if he is returned to power as well as readdressing the free movement of people within the European Union. Last month, Sarkozy, 59, announced that he wanted to run for the candidacy of the centre-right UMP party for the French Presidential Election scheduled to take place in April and May 2017. Scroll down for video . Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was joined at the campaign rally by his wife Carla Bruni . Ms Bruni, pictured, was said to be against her husband's plan to run again for the French presidency . However, her presence at the rally is seen as she is behind her husband's campaign to run again in 2017 . The former president addressed immigration, welfare tourism and the free movement of EU citizens during his speech. Sarkozy told his supporters: 'Schengen is no longer working, we want a new Schengen.' The Schengen agreement allowed for the free movement of EU citizens and removed border checks. Britain and Ireland opted out of joining the Schengen area. Sarkozy said: 'We can no longer afford the luxury of distributing a number of benefits to people in France illegally. 'Caring for someone in an emergency situation it is a moral imperative, but medical tourism is a scandal. 'I want to end benefits tourism in our country.' Sarkozy was defeated by socialist Francois Hollande in 2012 and told journalists at the time that they would never hear from him again. Sarkozy, pictured, said last month that he was running again because the socialists 'were ruining France' In his speech to UMP party supporters, Sarkozy said he would clamp down on welfare tourism if elected . But he indicated last year that he was considering a return to politics because the socialists 'were ruining France'. His wife, Carla Bruni, 46, had begged Sarkozy not to stand again as people were 'mean to him' when he was President. However, her presence at the rally in Nice will provide a significant boost to him in the opinion polls. Sarkozy's main rival for the UMP nomination is former French prime minister Alain Juppe, who has received the backing of former president Jacques Chirac.

The retailer was apparently Reece's one-stop shop for his favorite toys. 'Is there any way we can make [Target] not leave?' the youngster wails. 'I don't know what to tell you, they didn't make enough money,' Reece's father says. His son then comes up with a cunning plan to save Target. 'Well if we went there right now, we could buy something so they could make money,' Reece says as he continues to cry. His father says that they can pay a visit to Target tomorrow. However, he adds: 'I don't know if I have enough money to save them though.' Caught on camera: Video footage shows him suddenly breaking down in tears and petitioning 'I want Target back' - he even asks if they can go and buy something immediately in a bid to improve Target's cash flow . Target expanded into Canada two years ago, but has struggled to turn a profit, racking an estimated $2billion in losses. As a result the Minneapolis-based retailer is shutting its Canadian operation, closing 133 stores and laying off nearly 17,600 employees. Reece better get stocking up on goods quick. His mother says that Target's exit 'breaks his heart.' She added: 'His favorite store is closing, and now he thinks he will never be able to get the best Skylanders [toys] ever again!

Very tight, very tight at the back,' Mertesacker claims midway through the video, heaping praise on his own performance. The six-foot-six centre-back continues with his commentary, claiming there should have been a red card when Bacary Sagna collides with an opposition player.

But for one mother, the reaction she got when her daughter recognised her face for the first time was one she will never forget. Baby Louise was born with albinism, a condition which affects the amount of melanin in the skin and can also impair vision. Baby Louise, pictured, was born with albinism, a condition which had impaired her vision, and she needed to have glasses fitted . This means that she had been unable to see her mother's face clearly and needed glasses to correct her eyesight. And the heartwarming moment the baby was fitted with her first pair of specs, she was able to see clearly for the first time and looked on in amazement at recognising her mother's face. The fitting was captured on camera and shows Louise's glasses being fitted and adjusted around her face. Her mother then calls her name and claps her hands, and the youngster looks around to see what all of the fuss is about. At first Louise didn't look impressed with her new specs, but after hearing her mother call her name and clap she became excited . Then a big smile breaks out across her face after she recognises her mother and can clearly see her face for the first time ever . But on realising that it is her mother and she can see her face properly for the first time, Louise looks on in shock and a big smile breaks out across her face. The clip, which has already been viewed almost 700,000 times in six days, came with the caption: 'Our sweet Louise who has Albinism, received her glasses! 'This is her reaction from putting them on for the first time. It seems like she is really 'seeing' her mommy for the first time. Love!' Albinism is a genetic condition, which affects the production of melanin affecting the skin, hair and eyes. The lack of pigment in the iris causes sufferers to often have red or grey coloured eyes, but also affects the retina leading to vision problems. It is thought that the condition affects 1 in 17,000 people in the US.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Baby Louise suffers from albinism, a condition which impaired her vision .\\nThis meant she had never been able to clearly see her mother's face .\\nThe youngster was then fitted with her own pair of glasses to help her see .\\nThe moment she received her first pair of specs was captured on camera .\\nShows Louise looking on in amazement as she recognises her mother for the first time .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN)Vince Camuto, the iconic women's footwear designer and co-founder of Nine West, has died.

Natalie Wisneski, 47, was forced to resign in March after an internal investigation by the college football's Fiesta Bowl discovered the widespread misuse of bowl money. That probe widened into the brewing scandal. The nine-count indictment against Wisneski says she solicited campaign contributions from Fiesta Bowl employees for elections over several election cycles, and reimbursed the contributors with Fiesta Bowl funds. She then filed false election records and tax returns to hide the contributions, the indictment alleges. It says Wisneski had conspired with others from 2003 through 2011. Among recipients of the contributions were the re-election campaigns of Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl, Gov. Jan Breuer, and Rep. J.D. Hayworth. The contributions also included funds for McCain's presidential election in 2008. In addition, $10,000 was provided and covered up for the second-term inauguration of then-Gov. Janet Napolitano in 2007, the indictment alleges. The acting U.S. attorney for Arizona, Ann Birmingham Scheel, announced the indictment Wednesday in Phoenix.

Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:57 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:02 EST, 13 November 2013 . Heart failure that kills thousands of Brits every year could be cured by a simple jab which shrinks the vital organ, according to a new study. Scientists who have reversed the condition in animals by injecting them with a gene now hope tests on patients will be just as successful. They found the ‘SUMO-1’ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. Heart failure happens when the heart is unable to pump blood adequately. It affects over 750,000 people in the UK - mainly the elderly - and claims 140,000 lives a year. The ¿SUMO-1¿ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. There are treatments but no cure. In the final experiments before human clinical trials SUMO-1, a gene which is 'missing in action' in heart failure patients, was delivered directly into the organ. Dr Roger Hajjar, who led the study, said: 'SUMO-1 gene therapy may be one of the first treatments that can actually shrink enlarged hearts and significantly improve a damaged heart’s life-sustaining function. 'We are very eager to test this gene therapy in our patients suffering from severe heart failure.' Dr Hajjar is already on a path toward approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the US to test the revolutionary treatment on patients. It will be the second gene therapy treatment launched by he and his colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. The first, named CUPID, is in its final phases after successful tests on animals and substantial clinical improvements in patients. In that project, a gene known as SERCA2 which produces an enzyme critical to the proper pumping of calcium out of cells, is injected via a harmless virus. In heart failure SERCA2 is dysfunctional forcing the heart to work harder and in the process grow larger. The virus carrying SERCA2 is delivered through the coronary arteries into the heart using tiny tubes. Studies show only one dose is required to restore healthy production of the gene’s beneficial enzyme. But a study by Dr Hajjar and his researchers published two years ago showed SUMO-1 is also decreased in failing human hearts. The injection could reduce the need for invasive heart surgery, scientists hope . Dr Hajjar said: 'The key reason for this translational medicine speed is the outstanding infrastructure we have in the Cardiovascular Research Centre at Mount Sinai where we are able to replicate human heart failure models to test our novel gene therapies. 'I think this is a really very unique example of rapid translation of a promising medical therapy from an initial discovery to pre-clinical trials.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Researchers have successfully tested the injection on animals .\\nThe ‘SUMO-1’ therapy shrinks bloated hearts, improving circulation .\\nHeart disease claims 140,000 victims every year .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA top Nigerian military official believes he knows the whereabouts of girls kidnapped last month, but he says the nation's military will not use force to try to rescue them, a state news report said Monday. \"We want our girls back. I can tell you that our military can and will do it, but where they are held, can we go there with force?\" asked Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. \"Nobody should say Nigerian military does not know what it is doing; we can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back.\" His comments were reported by the News Agency of Nigeria, a state-run news service. Badeh continued: \"The good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you. \"We cannot come and tell you the military secret, just leave us alone, we are working to get the girls back,\" he reportedly said. In response to the news, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN U.S. officials were not able to confirm the report. More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria last month by Boko Haram, an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. The Nigerian military suffered an embarrassing setback when it retracted a report that nearly all the kidnapped girls were released. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Boko Haram translates as \"Western education is a sin\" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

Israel has not demonstrated that it will conduct thorough and objective investigations, Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"An independent investigation is crucial to understand why so many civilians died and to bring justice for the victims of unlawful attacks,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for the New York-based organization. In September, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a report by noted South African jurist Richard Goldstone. The report concluded that both sides committed war crimes during the conflict, which killed about 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. But U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said last week that the world body has not made a determination on whether both sides have done enough to investigate allegations they committed war crimes during the three-week conflict, which began at the end of December 2008. In a report, Ban outlines steps Israelis and Palestinians have taken to fulfill a U.N. demand for credible and transparent inquiries into civilian casualties. However, he concludes, \"As such, no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned.\" Israel handed Ban a response outlining the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of the offensive in Gaza, which was aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel. The Israeli military has \"launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,\" according to the report. For its part, the Palestinian Authority said it had created a commission to look into various charges of abuses, but made clear that it did not view the potential wrongdoing on the Palestinian side as seriously as that allegedly committed by the Israeli military. \"There is absolutely no symmetry or proportionality between the occupying power and the occupied people\" wrote Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations. In Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement released a summary of the steps taken to investigate wrongdoing, saying it had prevented militants from targeting civilians. But the rights organization dismissed the conclusion as \"factually wrong.\" Human Rights Watch said it is still reviewing a full Hamas report. \"Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,\" Stork said. \"Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians.\" CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Human Rights Watch says Israel has not shown it will conduct objective probe .\\nGroup also faults Hamas report on Gaza conflict, which it is still reviewing .\\nBoth sides are reporting on alleged war crimes during Gaza conflict a year ago .\\nAbout 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during the Israeli incursion .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nIn focus -- Iraq's Economic Revival  Iraq is experiencing a massive construction boom, especially in Baghdad where greater security has led to many companies investing in real estate projects.

Cavendish, the pre-race favorite on a course well-suited to his talents, timed his burst to perfection to take gold from Australia's Matthew Goss with Andre Greipel of Germany taking the bronze medal. It was Britain's first men's road race title since the legendary Tom Simpson won in 1965 and took them to the top of the medals table at the championships in Copenhagen. They claimed two gold, two silvers and two bronze medals as their dominance in track cycling extended to the various road disciplines. Cavendish paid tribute to his teammates after they had paced him through the majority of the 260km race over 17 laps but with a tough uphill finish. \"There couldn't be any other result after the way the guys rode today,\" Cavendish told Eurosport. \"I'm so proud.\" An early breakaway gained nearly 10 minutes, but with Britain forcing the pace at the front, it was pulled back and the decisive action took place on the last lap. Tour de France hero Thomas Voeckler made a typical charge, but with time trial silver medalist Bradley Wiggins and the experienced David Millar to the fore, Britain were able to nullify his attempt. In the uphill finish, it was the Australians who moved to the front, but Cavendish came through fast near the barriers and once he hit the front there was only one winner. Milan-San Remo winner Goss closed on the line while Greipel edged out Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara for the final podium spot.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Britain's Mark Cavendish wins world road race title in Copenhagen .\\nCavendish sprints to victory ahead of Australia's Matthew Goss .\\nCavendish first Briton to win prestigioius race since Tom Simpson in 1965 .\\nBritain top the medals table in Denmark with two golds, two silvers and two bronzes .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Nutek Disposables of Pennsylvania has issued a voluntary recall for its baby wipes because some packages may contain a bacteria that's often resistant to common antibiotics.

Police are investigating how a two-year-old Colorado girl who spent New Years Eve in hospital came to test positive for THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The incident started on Tuesday when Aida Hernandez stumbled upon her daughter eating a cookie left sitting in the front yard of an apartment complex in Longmont. Hernandez told police she instructed the toddler to stop and throw the random sweet back in the garden. Scroll down for video . This two-year-old girl (right, pictured with her sister) spent New Years Eve in hospital after eating a cookie that was placed with marijuana, police believe . Aida Hernandez noticed her daughter was acting strangely 'about half an hour' after finding her eating a random cookie out the front of their apartment block . Scene: Police are investigating the incident, but say they not found any reason to discredit the story provided to them by the family . Police say the two-year-old girl (right) has now fully recovered . The pair then went on a trip to the grocery store, when the mom realized something was wrong with her little girl. 'She was sleepy, she was opening and closing her eyes, and she couldnâ€™t walk very well,' Hernandez told FOX31 Denver. A toxicology test was performed and her urine tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. The incident occurred the day before Colorado ended prohibition laws on Marijuana. As of January 1, adults 21 and over are able to buy the drug at dispensaries across the state, allowing people to smoke and eat weed in the privacy of their homes. The toddler spent the night in hospital recovering and returned home on Wednesday. Marijuana is now legally sold in a variety of forms - from free-packaged to joints and edibles - as part of a new government experiment in regulating the drug like alcohol . Edible marijuana products, such as suckers (pictured), are regulated under new Colorado drug the same way as free-standing marijuana is, in terms of how much each adult is allowed in weight . Since marijuana sales started in Colorado, the most typical way to buy the drug is on its own, however joints and edibles are also available . Cmdr.

Jose Mourinho's side have jetted out for a pre-season charity tournament where they play two 45 minute friendly matches against Besiktas and Fenerbahce. Senegalese striker Ba, who scored 14 goals in 51 matches during his 18 months at Chelsea, left Stamford Bridge for Besiktas last month after falling down the pecking order behind new signing Diego Costa and Fernando Torres. Fancy seeing you here!: Ramires looks happy to see old pal Demba Ba in Turkey . But Ba seemed happy in his new surroundings as he chatted to the Brazilian midfielder ahead of the event which will raise funds for the families of the 301 people killed in May's Soma mining disaster. He also caught up with old pal Eden Hazard after the game. An explosion and subsequent fire left 787 workers buried underground leading to a four-day rescue effort and three days of national mourning. It was the worst disaster of its kind in Turkey. Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was photographed wearing a T-shirt in support of those affected. Show of support: Mark Schwarzer poses for a photograph in Soma T-shirt . Happy times: Demba Ba and Ramires celebrate goal during Chelsea's match with Sunderland in December 2013 . Old friends: Demba Ba poses with Chelsea's Eden Hazard after the game . All of the players donned the shirt during the warm-up. The games should give Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho another chance to work out his best XI ahead of the Premier League season, while giving his World Cup stars another chance to impress.

On the run: Somali-born jihadist Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he cut off his tag . Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he gave authorities the slip by cutting off his ankle tag with a sharp instrument. The details of how easily he got away heaped fresh pressure on the Home Office and police yesterday. Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic’s travel document. In fact, officers were never able to find one. The Home Office said Mohamed’s passport had been cancelled – but refused to say if this happened before or after he fled. Sources revealed how the terror suspect removed the ankle tag, fitted as a condition of his terrorism prevention order (T-Pim), after entering the An-Noor mosque in West London last Friday. He had arrived at 10am and left at 3.15pm. The tag sent a ‘tamper-alert’ to its maker, private security firm G4S, which then rang Mohamed to check where he was. It was only when he did not respond to the call that police and the Home Office were alerted. But by the time officers arrived he had disappeared. Wanted: CCTV images issued by the Met Police of Mohamed who is wanted by Scotland Yard terror officers . Security officials launched a major manhunt for the jihadist, but fear he may already have fled to Somalia. On Monday, Mrs May told MPs  that police had Mohamed’s British passport. But yesterday she said Mohamed was not in possession of his British passport when he returned to the UK after being arrested overseas, so ‘there was no passport for the police to seize’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons  Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘When there are only eight people on T-Pims they [the Home Office] ought to know every detail about them.’ A Whitehall official dismissed suggestions Mohamed had fled using the travel document, saying: ‘As far as we know he didn’t have a passport.’ Admission: Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic¿s travel document.

Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. \"There are a 182 potential claimants out there,\" Winkler said. \"There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases.\" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. \"I look forward to signing this legislation into law,\" Pawlenty said in a statement. \"It provides needed relief and support for victims and family members directly impacted by the I-35W bridge tragedy. I'm pleased that Senator Latz, Representative Winkler, my office and others were able to work together to craft this legislation.\" The bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour August 1, sending dozens of cars tumbling into the Mississippi River. Photos of the scene showed cars, trucks and a school bus lingering on the bridge's uneven remnants. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why the bridge collapsed. In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators studying the bridge found that 16 gusset plates, which strengthen the junctions of steel beams, were fractured. The bad gussets were found at eight joints in the main center span. \"When one element began to fail, it's like dominoes falling down,\" Rosenker said. But he emphasized, \"We have not yet determined the probable cause of this accident.\" The final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said.

The 150-pound tortoise decided to make a break for it in Alhambra, California, on Saturday. But he was no match for local police, who found the creature wandering the streets east of Los Angeles. \"Almost had a pursuit!\" the Alhambra Police Department wrote on its Facebook page. \"It took two officers to take this guy into custody,\" they explained -- because of the creature's weight. Handcuffs, they joked, weren't an option. In short order, police say, Clark was reunited with his family. Locals chimed in on Facebook, most celebrating Clark's safe return. One woman claimed she saw the tortoise while he was on the lam \"eating grass and leaves and moving at a fast clip.\" Others made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle jokes. But the Alhambra Police Department shut those down, writing that Clark \"did not respond to 'Michelangelo,' 'Leonardo,' 'Raphael,' or 'Donatello.'\" It's not the first time the police department has taken a walk on the wild side. The department encountered a man riding his horse through town on July 30. And on August 1, officers stopped another man who went for an evening jog in the nude. When officers asked the naked man what he was doing, they say, he told them he'd taken a pill and \"decided to go for a run.\" Alhambra Police did not speculate whether drugs played a role in Clark's decision to lead them on a low-speed chase.

None of the products received by the FDA were approved for sale in the United States, and they contained various levels of oseltamivir phosphate, the drug in Tamiflu. \"Medicines purchased from Web sites operating outside the law put consumers at increased risk due to a higher potential that the products will be counterfeit, impure, contaminated or have too little or too much of the active ingredient,\" Hamburg said.

They have so far spent £3,317 trying to pass the exam, which costs £31 a time. The test includes a 57-minute multiple choice exam, with a pass mark of 43 out of 50, and a hazard perception test with a pass mark of 44 out of 75. Fail: one determined Londoner still hasn't passed after flunking the test 107 times . Once you’ve passed both parts of the theory, there’s still the practical to overcome. One determined 40-year-old logged a record number of practical driving tests – passing on his 37th attempt. The unnamed man, from Stoke-on-Trent, forked out at least £2,294 trying to pass – which could have paid for a reasonable second-hand car. The practical test costs £62 to take on a weekday or £75 for a test on an evening, weekend or bank holiday. An AA Driving School spokesman said: ‘This is an unusually high number of test attempts, but it is important to remember that everyone learns at their own pace. Their determination to pass highlights how important learning to drive is to most people.

Hayley O'keeffe . PUBLISHED: . 06:02 EST, 24 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:05 EST, 24 December 2013 . Two members of the jailed Russian protest punk band Pussy Riot have vowed to set up a human rights organisation. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina were granted amnesty on Monday, two months short of their scheduled release. The move has been seen as the Kremlin's attempt to soothe criticism of Russia's human rights record ahead of the February Winter Olympics in Sochi. Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova (right) and Maria Alyokhina (left) hold hands as they walk outside Yemelyanovo airport in Krasnoyarsk . Alekhina flew into the eastern Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk early Tuesday to be reunited with Tolokonnikova. They have said the amnesty and their release was a publicity stunt by the Kremlin ahead of the Olympics. Tolokonnikova has also called for a boycott of the Olympics. Alekhina, still dressed in a dark green prison jacket, hugged Tolokonnikova and then shook hands. The pair have announced plans to set up a human rights organisation, after being sentenced to two years in prison for their cathedral protest . Both women reiterated that they would like to focus their future work on helping prisoners, and that they will discuss setting up a human rights organisation. The band's third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on suspended sentence shortly after the three were found guilty of hooliganism and sentenced to two years in prison in 2012 for their protest at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow. On trial: The pair sitting in a glass-walled cage in a court in Moscow during their 2012 trial. They have been released two months early in what is seen as a pre-Winter Olympics publicity stunt . The women have denied the accusations that they were driven by hatred of religion, and said their performance was aimed at raising concern about the close ties between the church and state.

His reputation has been bubbling away for a season or so but he announced himself to the Championship with a fine hat-trick against Reading in the 6-1 win at St Andrew’s. Tell me more… . He has come through the same Birmingham youth system that produced Nathan Redmond, Jack Butland and Sone Aluko and was given his debut by Lee Clarke as a late sub in October 2013 aged 17 and 95 days. Demarai Gray (right) celebrates smashing a hat-trick against Reading on Saturday . He is blessed with frightening pace, an ability to dribble, and good technique, although before his recent goals he had scored only twice in 25 appearances (albeit mainly from the bench). Who has he been compared to? Redmond is the obvious example because of their Birmingham connection, but he shares a similar style and stature also to Raheem Sterling, admittedly with far to go before possibly reaching the Liverpool player’s level. What’s his story? Born in Birmingham, Gray attended Frankley High in the south of the city. His sugary touch found an adequate platform through Cadbury Athletic, a team connected to the Bournville-based chocolate factory. At 11 he was scouted by Birmingham and has been at their academy ever since. Gray (left) is attracting interest from several Premier League clubs but has been urged to stay at Birmingham . Gray (left) seals his hat-trick against Reading with a neat finish on Saturday . He describes himself as ‘bubbly, calm and happy’ and says his perfect pre-match meal is egg and toast. Ravel Morrison has been his most skillful team-mate. Talk me through this hat-trick… . It came in 34 first-half minutes. His first was a burst from central midfield to the edge of the area where he dispatched a low finish into the far corner. His second saw him race past two defenders to the right of the area and fire a shot back across goal sooner than keeper Adam Federici expected. His third was a cool finish from the left after arriving onto David Davis’s pass at full speed. Is he attracting attention from bigger clubs? Certainly, and manager Gary Rowett is braced for bids in January. Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected on transfer deadline day in the summer, an offer the club saw as vastly inferior to any they might countenance. Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle have all also been linked with monitoring his situation. Gray has 18 months left on his current deal but has been offered a two-year extension by Birmingham.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Demarai Gray scored hat-trick for Birmingham City against Reading .\\nWinger is on the radar of Liverpool, Tottenham and Crystal Palace .\\nGray is similar in style to Raheem Sterling and Nathan Redmond .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Allan Hall . Waking Michael Schumacher from his artificially-induced coma could plunge him into a natural one, a top German professor has warned. The seven-times Formula 1 champion is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital in France. But Professor Heinzpeter Moecke says waking him may leave him in a 'permanent vegetative state'. Devoted: Michael Schumacher has been at University Hospital in Grenoble since December. Above, Schumacher is pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy . Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all . 'There is unfortunately the risk that in sneaking out of a deep artificial sleep the patient is then in a waking coma,' said Professor Moecke, director of the Institute for Emergency Medicine at the Asklepios Clinic in Hamburg. 'This would mean a permanent vegetative state where Schumacher would effectively be paralysed.' However, he said that even if the F1 legend does not plunge into another coma, doctors may be forced to send him into a 'light sleep'. 'Waking up from an artificial sleep can leave the patient initially confused, not sure of who he is or where he is,' he said. Treatment: Schumacher is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital (above) in France . 'If he is so agitated and attempted to remove tubes from his body, the doctors could induce him into another light sleep.' Schumacher, 45, has been at the hospital in Grenoble since he fell and hit his head on a rock while skiing in the French resort of Meribel on December 29. However, doctors believe that the toughest phase in his recovery is yet to come. They have warned his wife Corinna, and children Gina Marie, 16, and son Mick, 14, that it could take weeks for all of the sleeping drugs to be out of his body. During this time, Schumacher will be under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all. And even if he does come around, he may require intensive physical and speech therapy over a series of months, if not, years.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Heinzpeter Moecke warns Schumacher may plunge into natural coma .\\nClaims waking F1 legend could leave him in 'permanent vegetative state'\\nSchumacher has been at University Hospital in Grenoble since December .\\nDoctors believe the toughest phase of his recovery is still to come .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The NCAA says it has contacted the FBI after point-shaving allegations were lodged against Auburn University's men's basketball program. \"We are very concerned by the point-shaving allegations involving Auburn University men's basketball program and have been in contact with the school and the FBI since the issue arose in February,\" the NCAA said this week in a statement. \"The NCAA takes any allegation of point shaving very seriously because sports wagering threatens two of our core principles -- the well-being of student-athletes and the very integrity of intercollegiate sport.\" Auburn also says it has contacted the FBI. \"Auburn officials were made aware of a rumor regarding an allegation two weeks ago and immediately reported it to the FBI, the NCAA and the (Southeastern Conference).

The informal butchery and barbeque joint is a place where social and racial barriers are set aside as locals and out-of-towners come together to eat, drink and party. Even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a fan, recently describing Mzoli's as \"sexy\" and praising the \"incredible flavor\" of its grilled meat. Also known as Kwa-Mzoli, Mzoli's Place or Mzoli's Butchery, Mzoli's is a meeting place that brings together people from all walks of life. It was opened in 2003 in Gugulethu, a township 15 km from the center of Cape Town, South Africa, when owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele saw a gap in the market. \"We looked at what was missing in the market, especially in our community and we began to say, 'what can really bring people from all walks of life together?' And we came up with this -- Mzoli's,\" Ngcawuzele told CNN. \"You choose your meat, we grill it for you, you've got a table to sit at, and we serve you.\" South African winemaker's vintage year . At Mzoli's, diners select their meat from the butchery and then take it to one of the surrounding stalls, where it is grilled over charcoal fires. The locals call it a \"braai,\" the Afrikaans word for barbecue, and a South African specialty. But Mzoli's attracts a clientele hungry for more than just braai. Live music, and DJs playing kwaito and house music draw a diverse crowd, including white South Africans who might not normally make the journey into the black township. Ngcawuzele told CNN, \"We said, 'this is the rainbow nation, how do we manage to bring the rainbow nation together into one spot, where white, black, colored, everyone gets together over a piece of meat?' \"We get a lot of tourists, a lot of the local community, the white community, the colored community. They just come from all walks of life. \"I can tell you now, the racial tensions of the past, that is the past. Today we're moving forward, looking forward from generation to generation. \"Everybody is welcome. It's safe, people are walking the streets, the doors are wide open in the neighborhood here.

Unfortunately, his sleepy passengers had hoped to wake up in Tywyn, near Cardigan Bay in west Wales. The Llew Jones International coach, like the one pictured above, was returning from Paris .

Mrs Williams added: ‘They ended up in Towyn, and then took an extra hour and a half to get back home, to the correct town. ‘I'm not happy at all by what happened, especially because Sian suffers from travel sickness and so do a few other kids.’ The driver took the pupils and teachers to Towyn, Conwy, before delivering them to Tywyn, Gwynedd, above . Cllr . Louise Hughes, whose daughter was also on the trip with 36 other . pupils, said: ‘I was very annoyed by what happened. I am glad they all . got back safely. ‘Delivery drivers make the same mistake and people ring, saying, “We can’t find you, we’re in Towyn”.

Nate Murphy, whose famous finds include Leonardo, one of the best-preserved dinosaurs in the world, will make that plea in federal court in Billings, Montana. Earlier this month, Murphy pleaded guilty to state charges of stealing a fossil from private land in order to sell it. An expert cited in that case said Murphy's find was worth between $150,000 and $400,000. The self-taught dinosaur expert, who is director of vertebrate paleontology at the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, could face jail time. Murphy and his attorney did not immediately respond to phone messages Friday from CNN. Jessica Fehr, lead prosecutor in the case, said the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment until after the plea is entered. In court papers, federal prosecutors say Murphy knowingly took fossils from federal property between about August 2006 and August 2007. The \"paleontological resources\" were said to be worth at least $1,000. In the state case, Murphy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of theft. As part of the plea, the state recommended Murphy's sentence be deferred for five years. Douglas Erwin, president of The Paleontological Society and curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said \"theft of fossils from pubic lands has long been a problem.\" In a written statement sent to CNN on Friday, he said such thefts \"can often result in the loss of important scientific information and the disappearance of specimens that belong to the public. \"At the same time, however, fossil collecting, particularly of common invertebrate fossils, has been a pastime enjoyed by many for decades, and is an important way of connecting people with their natural heritage.\" An omnibus public lands bill, which the U.S. Senate passed Thursday, includes penalties for fossil theft from public land.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Attorney says well-known paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones .\\nNate Murphy, of the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, has made major fossil finds .\\nMurphy is accused of taking fossils from federal lands in Montana .\\nSmithsonian: \\\"Theft of fossils from pubic lands has long been a problem\\\"\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Sarah Wales, 32, allegedly collected and distributed child rape photos while living at  Washington-based military installation Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where her partner was stationed, in 2013. She also reportedly used a Canadian instant messaging service to describe her fantasy of sexually assaulting a young girl, before killing her and dismembering her body.

Last Tuesday, Wales was arrested  in Spokane following a year-long investigation. She has been charged with three counts of distributing child pornography and one count of possessing it. The FBI began investigating Wales in June 2013 after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a tip from the IM service that there were suspicious activities on Wales's account. They discovered she had been using the site to swap stories about children being raped and beaten, a court filing by an FBI agent with the South Sound Child Exploitation Task Force alleges. During the exchanges, Wales even told other users that she had sexually assaulted children, while trading pornographic images and videos of youngsters, it is claimed.

During the interviews, she told agents her online conversations were 'disgusting' but 'strictly role playing', according to charging papers obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 'Wales stated that she received all her images containing child pornography from other members of the chat room,' an FBI agent told the court..

Pink Floyd's lead singer Roger Waters also sang the praises of his 12-12-12 onstage partner, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The two vocalists teamed up for a rendition of Pink Floyd's 1979 hit, \"Comfortably Numb,\" alternating on the song's lyrics. \"Eddie was absolutely amazing, so that was like a dream come true to have him come and sing 'Comfortably,' that was magical,\" Waters told CNN backstage following his performance. The Pink Floyd frontman was so thrilled with his onstage partner that he says he even took a break from performing to show him some love. \"I actually think I stopped singing at one point to kiss him, which is weird!\" Waters told CNN. \"That's very rare that I do anything like that.\" Other performers partaking in the benefit concert included Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and The Who.

A spokesperson for Robin Hood tells CNN that the foundation will not have a final tally of how much the concert raised overall until Monday, but confirms that advance revenue generated from ticket sales, sponsors and corporate donations reached more than $30 million.

Kit Holden . Toni Kroos has today continued to rule out a move away from Bayern Munich, despite being urged by his former mentor Jupp Heynckes to stay at the club. Kroos, who has recent months been heavily linked with Manchester United in both England and Germany, is still yet to put pen to paper for a new deal with the reigning European Champions. Former Bayern coach Heynckes publicly advised Kroos to stay at the club this week. Not only was Heynckes the brains behind Bayern’s treble winning side last season, he was also the man who established Kroos as a star during his loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen several years ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Toni Kroos's best goals and see him appear in advert . Hands off: Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos has refused to rule out leaving the German giants . Contract talks: The German's deal runs out next summer and he has been linked with Man Utd and Arsenal . In an interview in today’s Bild, Kroos was full of praise for his former coach, saying that 'he is the most important coach I have ever worked with. His is one of a few opinions who I value very highly. It was great to hear what he thinks.' Nonetheless, the midfielder refused to rule out a move, insisting that 'it is my future, and my decision.' With Kroos’ contract expiring at the end of next season, Bayern are desperate to extend the deal, as they currently risk losing him on a free. The negotiations reportedly continue to stall over wages, however, and Bayern’s insistence on playing hard ball over details has evoked a great deal of interest from a number of clubs. Not only United, but also Arsenal and the top clubs in Spain have now been linked to the player. Most in Germany are still confident that Kroos will stay at Bayern, with TZ writing today that 'he would have no reason to leave'. But as Bayern move no closer to extending the deal, and both Arsenal and United likely to be raiding the transfer market in the coming months, the prospect seems increasingly realistic. Respected: Former Bayern boss Jupp Heynckes has urged the midfielder to sign a new deal at Bayern Munich . Kroos’ relationship with Guardiola has also been called into question this season, with public disagreements filling the sports pages. The player, though, praised his current coach’s preparation for tonight’s crunch Champions League tie with Real Madrid. 'He knows Madrid perfectly, and has advised us well. No one should have any doubts that we will be on our game'. Tension: Despite Kroos' praise of coach Pep Guardiola, rumours are rife the two don't get on very well .

Gazprom's current chief executive, Alexey Miller. It controls 20 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and operates the world's largest gas distribution network -- approximately 157,000 kilometers of pipelines covering an area from Europe to the Far East, according to its Web site. Gazprom exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the European Union's gas supplies. Last month it reported an 85 percent increase in net profits to $20.8 billion for the first six months of 2008. In 2007 it reported annual profits totaling nearly $61 billion. In 2008 the Financial Times placed it fourth on its list of the world's top 500 corporations, as ranked by market capitalization. Formed in 1989 to replace the Soviet Ministry of the Gas Industry, Gazprom is closely tied to the Russian government, which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company. Current Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is a former Gazprom chairman. In recent years, an increasingly confident Moscow has used Gazprom to assert its authority over Russia's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to ex-Soviet countries such as Ukraine and Belarus. But that policy has led to disputes as Gazprom has then sought to raise prices. Gazprom last week switched off gas supplies to Ukraine for the second time in two years in a row over payments and Kiev's rejection of a proposal which would have increased the cost of gas to $250 per 1,000 cubic meter. Instead Gazprom said Ukraine would have to pay the full market rate of $418 dollars per 1,000 cubic meter. Other countries including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Greece and Turkey have complained that their gas supplies have also been affected at the height of demand as winter temperatures dip well below freezing in many places.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Russia's Gazprom one of world's most powerful energy companies .\\nGazprom controls 20 percent of world's natural gas reserves .\\nRussian government owns controlling stake; Company made $61B last year .\\nKremlin has used Gazprom to exert influence over former Soviet states .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Thailand's recent political troubles may have worked in Japan's favor when it came to this year's Travel + Leisure awards, with Kyoto knocking Bangkok off its spot at the top of the magazine's world's best cities list.

Ieng Thirith, who served as minister for social affairs in the Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s, had been accused of crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, genocide, homicide, torture and religious persecution. However, proceedings against her were halted in November last year after the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia decided she could not face trial as she suffered from dementia. After seeking further medical assessment, the court issued a statement Thursday confirming the earlier diagnosis that Ieng Thirith suffers from a \"progressive, degenerative illness (likely Alzheimer's disease) and remains unfit to stand trial.\" Judge resigns from court trying Khmer Rouge crimes . It added that medical experts confirmed that \"all treatment options have now been exhausted and that the accused's cognitive impairment is likely irreversible.\" As a result, the court recognized she would be incapable of remembering or complying with any conditions -- but reminded her not to interfere in their investigations in any way and to remain in Cambodia. Khmer Rouge torture prison chief gets life sentence . Ieng Thirith, 80, was one of four surviving leaders of the brutal regime facing prosecution -- the others being her husband Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister; Khieu Samphon, the nominal head of state; and Nuon Chea, the prime minister, also known as Brother Number 2. They remain on trial. The head of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, was known as Brother Number 1. He died in 1998, long before the U.N.-backed court came into existence. He had previously been married to Ieng Thirith's sister, Khieu Ponnary. Under Pol Pot's leadership, the Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge ordered people out of Phnom Penh, the capital, and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside. It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths, roughly a quarter of the population at the time. Its stated aim was to create a Communist utopia, but instead the regime forced Cambodians into what has been described as a living hell.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"U.N. court in Cambodia upheld earlier diagnosis that Ieng Thirith has dementia .\\nCourt: Experts say accused's cognitive impairment is 'likely irreversible'\\nThree others, include Ieng Thirith's husband, face charges of crimes against humanity .\\nKhmer Rouge regime's four-year rule in the 1970s is blamed for 1.7 million deaths .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nRio Ferdinand says young players in England are being paid too much too soon and believes the game needs to change.

Arteta signed three years ago from Everton for £10million and his contract is due to expire at the end of the season, by which time the Basque midfielder will be 33. Arsene Wenger’s standard policy for players over 30 is to offer them no more than 12 months at a time but this will suit Arteta, who inherited the captaincy from Thomas Vermaelen in the summer. Mikel Arteta is likely to extend his Arsenal contract, which expires at the end of the season . Negotiations are open and are unlikely to be affected by another niggling injury which will keep the skipper out of action until after the next international break. Arteta, ruled out for a month after twisting an ankle in Besiktas in August, hobbled off with a calf problem during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham and faces another three weeks out. Aaron Ramsey pulled a hamstring in the same game and faces a month out, but there was a more optimistic medical bulletin for Wenger from Jack Wilshere, who hurt an ankle against Spurs but has been told there is no serious damage. The England midfielder has not yet been ruled out of facing Galatasaray in the Champions League tomorrow night. Meanwhile, Gunners striker Olivier Giroud is said to have agreed a new four-year deal at the Emirates, worth £80,000-week. Aaron Ramsey is expected to be sidelined for a month after picking up a hamstring injury against Spurs . Jack Wilshere could ease Arsenal's injury crisis by returning for Champions League clash with Galatasaray .

The Prime Minister will award £1million to the person who solves the biggest problem of our time – we just have to figure out what it is first. David Cameron will today launch the global competition asking the brightest minds of the world to identify and solve humanity’s biggest challenge, hoping the result will change the world. The Prime Minister will announce the prize fund at the G8 Innovation Conference ahead of next week's meeting of leaders from the world's richest countries. It is hoped competition will result in the creation of revolutionary technologies such as new forms of low-carbon travel or advances in medical science to create replacement limbs. A Downing Street source said: ‘We want people to think big. What does the world need and how can we achieve that? 'We are looking for the next penicillin, aeroplane or worldwide web. ‘Can we grow limbs or create universal low-carbon travel? 'Something that is going to really revolutionise what we do and how we live our lives - sending us sprinting ahead in the global race.’ The initiative is inspired by the Longitude Prize set by the British government in 1714 which promised £20,000 to the person who mastered the challenge of calculating longitude at sea to help maritime navigation. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees will chair the new Longitude Committee, with £500,000 pledged by innovation organisation Nesta to support its work. The Prime Minister will also announce £50 . million of funding, from within the UK's aid budget, for ideas to make a . difference in the developing world.

A warrant was issued for Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar's arrest today - the day after he scored a dramatic equaliser against Manchester United in a remarkable 4-4 draw. Premier League star Pienaar, 30, is wanted after his Aston Martin DBS was caught speeding twice on the same road in the space of 11 days. The footballer failed to let the authorities know who was driving and today failed to appear at Chelmsford Magistrates Court. Dramatic: Steven Pienaar, left, scores a remarkable equaliser for Everton against Manchester United on Sunday in a game that finished 4-4 . A judge issued a warrant and said he should be bailed to appear on a date to be fixed so that he can be sentenced. The charge of failing to notify who was driving was proven in his absence. Pienaar, on loan at Everton from Spurs, faces a possible driving ban as each offence carries a minimum six penalty points. Under the totting up procedure anyone who reaches 12 points faces disqualification unless they can show that a ban would cause them exceptional hardship.

The attack, near the southeastern city of Kimberley, apparently happened Sunday while a husband and wife were out on an afternoon walk, Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesperson Sgt. Laurie Jalbert said. The woman was walking in front when she encountered a brown bear and cubs who were near a dead deer. The bear turned on the woman, Jalbert said, and her husband tried to help her. The bear then turned on him and began attacking him, then turned back to her. Somehow the couple managed to fight the animal off, and it left, Jalbert said. The husband is in his 80s. The wife is in her 60s. Both were rushed to Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and remain in stable condition. Both have head wounds and bites on their arms and legs. Jalbert said authorities believe the bear was a grizzly, but the husband said he thought it might be a black bear. If a bear is determined to have attacked someone, often it is put down, Jalbert said. During this time of year in that area, bears are starting to hibernate. Because this bear has cubs, it may be out of its den longer to gather food, Jalbert said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Couple out for walk survives bear attack near Kimberley, British Columbia .\\nThe husband, in his 80s, tried to help his wife, in her 60s, but the bear turned on him .\\nConservation authorities are looking for the bear, police say, and it may be put down .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

But that's what happened at a New York City McDonald's early Sunday morning - and the worker found himself locked in the bathroom as the fast-food restaurant was robbed. The unidentified guard, who probably won't be getting employee of the month, was patrolling the closed fast-food restaurant on Varick Street in lower Manhattan. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: The robbers were let in to the Varick Street McDonald's, pictured, in Greenwich Village by a security guard . At around 4:40 a.m., two men in their 20s knocked on the door and asked to be let in so they could use the ATM. A trusting soul, the security guard agreed and opened the door. But once inside, one of the men pulled a black and silver revolver out of his pocket and ordered the guard into the bathroom, locking him inside. Suspects: Police have released surveillance video, pictured, of two men they believe robbed a Manhattan McDonald's . Lookout: The footage shows a third man police believe acted as a lookout . The pair then ordered the rest of the employees to get on the floor, and they complied. They took about $200 in cash from one of the workers and grabbed about $2,800 from the safe, police sources told The New York Post. Police released a surveillance video showing the suspects calmly walking on the street before and after the heist. One is wearing combat shorts and the other a white baseball cap and T-shirt. As they walk away, the men are accompanied by a third man who police suspect was acting as a lookout.

Queensland police will allege the 20-year-old tourist answered an online job advertisement for a nanny based in the Stanthorpe area, near the Queensland-NSW border. She caught a night bus to the area on August 13, 2013, and was picked up by a man who drove her around for about an hour. Actor John Jarratt plays Mick Taylor in the film Wolf Creek. A 47-year-old Brisbane man allegedly lured a backpacker to a rural property in Queensland and drugged, tied up and raped her in a Wolf Creek-style attack . Police say the Brisbane man drugged the young woman with chocolate laced with the sedative zolpidem, which is sold under the brand name Stilnox, before taking her to a shed on a property 30km southwest of Stanthorpe. The woman claims that when she woke up she was cable tied to a bed. She said she was fed more chocolate and when she next woke up, at 1am on August 14, she was outside by the side of the road. The terrified woman called her sister in Germany before managing to make her way to a property at Spring Creek where she was found at 7am that same day. Details of the alleged kidnapping emerged after a 47-year-old Brisbane man was charged with a string of offences including kidnapping, rape, stupefying in order to commit an offence and deprivation of liberty. Queensland police will allege the 20-year-old tourist answered an online job advertisement for a nanny based in the Stanthorpe area, near the Queensland-NSW border . He was refused bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The court heard the man, a cleaner, was on bail for other charges when he was arrested on Monday. Defence lawyer Nathan Hounsell said his client should be granted bail because the evidence was circumstantial and he'd never failed to front court before. However, Magistrate Linda Bradford-Morgan said that after reading a police affidavit objecting to the man's bail she was satisfied there was a strong case against him. 'I am of the view that there is an unacceptable risk of reoffending or failing to appear if (he is) placed on bail,' she said. The case was adjourned until November 24. Outside court Mr Hounsell said his client would strongly contest the charges. 'He is clearly devastated at the refusal of bail however until the matters are finished he will remain in custody,' he told reporters.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"German backpacker allegedly lured to rural Queensland property and raped .\\nThe 20-year-old tourist answered a nanny job ad based near Stanthorpe .\\nPolice say the Brisbane man drugged her with Stilnox-laced chocolate .\\nThe woman claims that when she woke up she was cable tied to a bed .\\nShe said she was fed more chocolate and when she next woke up she was outside by the side of the road .\\nThe 47-year-old man was refused bail in a Brisbane court on Tuesday .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Inter Milan did all they could to keep the pressure up on Serie A leaders AC Milan as they beat lowly Cesena 2-1. But they left it very late. Two goals in injury time by striker Giampaolo Pazzini ensured Inter stay in touch with their city rivals, closing the gap to five points until Sunday at least, when Milan host mid-table Bologna. Cesena took the lead after 56 minutes thanks to Croatian striker Igor Budan and, as the finals minutes ticked down, looked to have claimed three vital points. But then Inter's unlikely comeback started with Samuel Eto'o delivering an inswinging cross into the box which Pazzini managed to poke home on the volley. Seconds later the Italian striker found himself in the right place at the right time again as he rose to meet Maicon's cross from the right to head home to complete a dramatic and bizarre turnaround. \"It was all calculated, it was organized from the first minute, everything went perfectly,\" Inter coach, Leonardo joked afterwards, AFP reported. \"We looked at it as a decisive game and it was very important to get the three points for the Champions League, even if qualification isn't yet secured. Winning in this way really is incredible even if it's not our first comeback,\" he added, AFP reported. The loss leaves Cesena in 16th place, although both Sampdoria (who face Brescia) and Lecce (who travel to Chievo) can both overtake them if they win on Sunday. In Saturday's other game third-placed Napoli kept up the pressure on Inter with a 1-0 win over Genoa -- Slovak midfielder Marek Hamsik with the goal seven minutes before the final whistle.

Jeb Bush swung back at critics of Common Core on Thursday, challenging those who refuse to adopt the controversial testing standards, which have made him a target by conservatives, to come up with something better. \"For those states that are choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: That's fine, except you should be aiming even higher and be bolder and raise standards and ask more for our students and our system,\" he said at a summit in Washington hosted by his education group, Foundation for Excellence in Education, a major backer of Common Core standards. His speech underscored a need for further education reform, a message likely to be a key part of his platform should he decide to run for president. As the potential GOP presidential field awaits his decision on a White House bid, Bush has said he'll make up his mind by the end of the year. His push for Common Core has made him a target for conservative ire. Some Republicans, backed up by polling that indicates the program struggles in popularity, complain that the program interferes with local government control, by infusing more Washington bureaucracy in education. The standards were developed by the bipartisan National Governors Association, state governments and nonprofit groups. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core. In that sense, the government created incentives for states to embrace the standards. Bush stressed that the struggles faced by students in low-income schools is a \"civil rights crisis,\" further arguing that \"fixing our schools\" must be one of the nation's most \"urgent priorities.\" On Common Core, Bush squarely hit back at critics who say the testing standards are too high. \"Let's get real about this,\" he said, ticking off statistics about poor performance among high school students preparing to go to college. \"The rigor of the Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms,\" â€‹he added, stressing the need to embrace challenging standards. Some of the most vocal opponents of the program include Bush's potential GOP presidential rivals, like Sen. Rand Paul, who took a subtle jab at Bush last month over the issue, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose state sued the Obama administration. Bush argued the debate has been \"troubling\" but said he believed \"nobody in this debate has a bad motive.\" Bush, who's also been an advocate for immigration reform, made no mention of Obama's plan to announce executive action on the issue Thursday night.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Former Florida Gov.

The unnamed toddler and her sibling were allegedly playing in a room at their home in Lorain, northeastern Ohio, on Sunday morning when the boy picked up a loaded gun. Seconds later, he accidentally pulled the trigger, causing a bullet to pierce his sister's head, according to authorities. Three other family members were reportedly in the house at the time. Scene: A three-year-old girl is in a 'critical' condition in hospital after being shot in the head by her four-year-old brother at their family home on the 1300 block of West 28th Street (above) in Lorain, northeastern Ohio . Police and paramedics were called to the property on the 1300 block of West 28th Street at around 10am, where they discovered the girl's father cradling her in his arms. The youngster was flown to Rainbow Babies Hospital Children's Hospital in Cleveland with a single gunshot wound, the Lorain Police Department told Cleveland.com. She remains in a 'critical' state. Following the shooting, investigators interviewed the three other people who were in the house at the time. They also recovered the gun from the scene. Prosecutors are now reviewing the incident to determine if charges will be filed. It is not the first time a young child has accidentally shot a sibling with a loaded weapon. Hospital: The girl was flown to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital (above) with a single gunshot injury . In April, a three-year-old girl killed her two-year-old brother after shooting him in the stomach with a .22-caliber rifle at their home in Utah. Although emergency crews arrived within minutes and rushed the badly wounded toddler  to a local hospital, he could not be saved. Police later said the girl had picked up the gun after her father had placed it down and walked away. In  Sunday's shooting, the police investigation is ongoing.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Girl, three, was playing with brother, four, at their home in Lorain, Ohio .\\nBoy stumbled across loaded gun, before accidentally pulling the trigger .\\nHis sister, who was shot in head, was airlifted to hospital in Cleveland .\\nShe currently remains in 'critical' state; no charges have yet been filed .\\nThree other relatives were in the house on West 28th Street at the time .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(WIRED) -- Say hello to your latest personal navigation device: a netbook. Dell plans to introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be integrated into the company's netbooks to turn them into gizmos that can offer turn-by-turn direction as well as any Garmin or TomTom. Dell will introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be added to its netbooks to offer turn-by-turn direction. \"Smartphones already have GPS capabilities,\" says Alan Sicher, senior wireless product manager at Dell. \"We are now bringing it to netbooks so the devices know where you are and can help you where you want to go.\" Customers will have the option to buy the $69 card called the Wireless 700 when ordering their Dell Mini 10 netbook. Dell's move comes at a time when navigation devices makers are looking beyond the traditional standalone GPS gadget and are offering their software on other devices. Last month, TomTom announced that its turn-by-turn directions app would be available on the iPhone. TomTom will also offer accessories such as a car mounting dock and power charger. Meanwhile, Dell is hoping to capitalize on the explosive sales of netbooks. Dell netbooks with the integrated GPS cards will allow consumers to pop open a netbook and get directions and also also make their netbook location aware. For instance, buyers can geo-tag photos on Flickr or check weather information customized to their current location. The Wireless 700 card combines Broadcom's GPS technology and Skyhook Wireless' Wi-Fi positioning solutions. As for the navigation software, it offers 2D and 3D map views, save addresses for a trip and route optimization-- pretty much all the things that a standard GPS devices does. Netbooks are petite devices. Still, it is difficult to imagine consumers carrying it around as a GPS navigation device or using it their car to find their way around--especially when smaller-sized cellphones could do the job. Sicher says Dell's GPS-capable netbooks will come in handy for international travelers. \"If you are traveling to Europe roaming costs can be pretty pricey for your cellphone,\" he says. The GPS netbooks could also be handy in areas where cellphone coverage is weak, says Sicher. But there's fine print to the turn-by-turn directions navigation software on the netbook. Though it will be free for buyers of the card and the netbook, the maps will be updated yearly and customers could be charged for the updates. Dell plans to offer accessories such as car charger and a dock for the netbooks, but they won't be available until later this month. The GPS cards will be available starting July 7.

According to a criminal complaint, Jared Layne Hansen faces charges of interfering with a flight crew, making false statements about having weapons and saying the plane was being hijacked, and assaulting federal air marshals. An arrest warrant was issued. Hansen, 31, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was sitting in seat 10B of the main cabin of Delta Flight 235. The trouble began, according to an affidavit filed by air marshal Dennis Scott, when Hansen tried to go into the front section of the cabin, which is restricted to business class passengers for security reasons. Hansen refused to obey instructions from the flight crew that he go back to his seat or to a bathroom in the rear cabin, the document alleges. \"Mr. Hansen threatened to urinate in the aircraft galley and grabbed his penis and threatened to urinate all over himself,\" according to the criminal complaint. Crew members summoned air marshals on the flight, saying they needed help with a passenger who appeared \"heavily intoxicated\" and was not behaving as requested. The court document says one marshal found Hansen standing in the galley exposing his genitals. When the officer approached him, the complaint said, Hansen clinched his fists and started hitting himself in the face. The marshals identified themselves as police officers and Hansen shoved two of them, the affidavit states. The marshals handcuffed Hansen and put him in his assigned seat. Hansen allegedly made a variety of false statements during the remainder of the flight -- sometimes yelling them out -- such as \"this is a hijacking.\" He allegedly claimed to have a handgun and a bomb. According to the complaint, he also said the air marshals aboard the plane were hijacking the plane and called them terrorists. Four marshals were on Flight 235. The statements frightened the passengers, the document states, adding Hansen allegedly threatened the air marshals by saying he would \"track us down.\" Hansen was detained and questioned by law enforcement upon arrival Tuesday in Detroit, but he was not arrested. \"We needed to do more investigation before we filed a criminal complaint,\" said Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. Kim Thompson, an official with the Federal Air Marshal Service, said she could not discuss the case and referred all questions to Justice Department officials.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Complaint: Passenger didn't go back to his seat when asked .\\nAmong other things, he allegedly threatened to urinate in aircraft galley .\\nAuthorities are trying to locate Utah man .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA thief made off with a hot air balloon at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that had been in the owner's family for three decades.

They have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see. The managers sent the note even though unbranded versions of Viagra, called sildenafil, are now cheap. A four-pill pack costs the NHS just £1.45, or 36p a tablet. Scroll down for video . 'Rationing':  Some NHS bosses have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see (file picture of model) The price of the anti-impotence pills has plummeted 93 per cent in the past year, since Viagra-maker Pfizer lost its patent. As a result, the Department of Health recently scrapped rules on prescribing sildenafil, so the vast majority of men with erectile dysfunction problems can get it on the NHS. But that decision – revealed in The Mail on Sunday last week – appears to have worried some local health managers fighting to balance their books. Cheap: Tablets of sildenafil, an unbranded version of Viagra used by the NHS, cost just 36p each . In a missive to GPs in the West Midlands, managers at NHS Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) demanded GPs limit their prescribing of sildenafil. They wrote: ‘In light of the pressure on NHS budgets, patients who are eligible for NHS treatment should be prescribed the lowest effective dose, with a maximum frequency of ONE tablet per week (ie FOUR per MONTH).’ But Dr Martin Duerden, a North Wales GP who advises the Royal College of General Practitioners on prescribing issues, asked: ‘Can we ration sex in this way? Prescriptions for sildenafil have no restrictions and each person should be assessed as individuals – some will need more, some less.’ GPs are free to prescribe what they like, based on what they think best for the patient, so such notes can only be advisory. However, CCGs can make life difficult for doctors they believe are costing them too much. NHS West Essex CCG has also warned doctors to look out for patients who might sell the pills for a profit. ‘Consider these drugs have a street value and quantities should be agreed after a discussion with the patient assessing realistic needs,’ they said. A spokesman for NHS West Essex CCG stressed it was not capping how much sildenafil doctors could prescribe, saying it was up to GPs. NHS Telford and Wrekin CCG did not comment.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Drop in cost of 'generic' Viagra recently led to the Department of Health making tablets available to patients on the NHS .\\nUnbranded version that they use - 'sildenafil' - costs just 36p per pill .\\nDespite this - some health managers are still worried about what they're spending on the drug and want to limit the amounts prescribed .\\nOne GP, Dr Martin Duerden, has criticised the idea of 'rationing sex'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nSunshine escapes are melting winter wonderlands when it comes to Britons’ holiday preferences as the UK descends into the dark, grey and cold period of the calendar.

More specifically, Brits want to hit locations they know they love with 40 per cent of flights heading to the Canary Islands. Tenerife, the largest island of the Spanish holiday favourite, is Britons' preferred destination with 24 per cent of all beach getaways booked there. Spanish resorts are as popular as ever with Alicante (16 per cent) and Malaga (12 per cent) in second and third with Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh (11 per cent) close behind.

Captured on video outside Lucky River, a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco's Sunnyside neighborhood, the chef appears to lift and slam two slabs of beef up and down onto the ground. When a concerned inspector from the city's health department arrived to question the apparently bemused staff, they simply said the man was attempting to tenderize the meat and 'defrost' it by beating it off the concrete. Food prep: The staff member at Lucky River restaurant in San Francisco prepares to slam the meat to the ground . Crash: The man was simply trying to tenderize the frozen meat before cooking it he and the restaurant later explained . However, when local news made the trip down to examine the exact section of sidewalk they discovered it was covered in gum, cigarette butts and general filth. The owner of the restaurant said that the defrosting incident was an isolated one and that the meat was never used in any meals. KPIX showed the gross footage to neighbors, Steve Vender and London Lacey. 'It's highly unsanitary, I don't know how they're gonna clean the meat off after that. They're gonna wash it but it certainly doesn't look very appealing,' said Vender. Gross: The residue and general muck on any given sidewalk is seen languishing outside the Lucky River restaurant exactly where the meat was being slammed down . Reviews: The Lucky River Restaurant has a satisfactory sanitation score with the San Francisco Public Health Department . Cancerous: A cigarette butt lies on the sidewalk outside the restaurant where the staff member threw down the meat . According to KPIX, Lucky River scored a satisfactory rating on its last health inspection. However, reviews on Yelp have been less than generous, with one person mentioning a boiled caterpillar in the vegetables. 'Yup. They boiled a caterpillar, Extra protein I guess,' they wrote. 'I won't eat there again,' said Lacey. 'I will not eat there at all.' After seeing the shocking video, the San Francisco Public Health Department gave the owners of Lucky River just one month to clean up their act or face closure. If the owners do not get their staff to enroll in an eight-hour Food Manager Class, earn and print food handlers cards and go on remedial food safety courses within one month, the restaurant will be forced to close.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Lucky River restaurant in San Francisco caught practicing questionable food preparation techniques .\\nChef was filmed beating the meat on the street in the Sunnyside neighborhood .\\nApparently staff didn't think anything was wrong with the practice when they were confronted about it .\\nOwner later said the meat wasn't served at the restaurant .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nHurricane Sandy is the second most powerful hurricane in modern history, with its might exceeding even that of Katrina, according to a measurement of the hurricane's strength in relation to its size. Researchers have found that Sandy's Integrated Kinetic Energy index, or IKE, which quantifies the power of a hurricane based on how far out tropical-storm force winds extend from the center, ranked second only to Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Hurricane Sandy's IKE was 140 Terajoules, which was about 20 Terajoules higher than Katrina's, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marin and Atmospheric Science.

'Sandy's IKE was over 140 Terajoules (TJ, 1 TJ = 1 trillion Joules = 277,778 kilowatt hours), meaning it generated more than twice the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb,' McNoldy wrote on a blog published by the Washington Post. 'At any given moment, many hurricanes contain more energy than an atomic bomb in their surface winds alone (even excluding winds at higher elevations and latent heat energy),' he added. The category levels that are more widely cited to quantify the power of hurricanes purely measure wind speed.   Katrina was measured as a Category 3 hurricane at landfall and later rose to a Category 5. The estimated cost of Hurricane Sandy is $20 billion . Residents walk past burned houses in Breezy Point, a neighborhood located in the New York City borough of Queens, after it was devastated by Hurricane Sandy . Sandy, meanwhile, was measured as a Category 1 hurricane at landfall. But Sandy may end up being the second costliest hurricane in history after Katrina because of its high IKE, McNoldy noted. 'Sandy had Category 1 winds at landfall yet was able to create very significant storm surge over hundreds of miles of highly populated coastline,' he wrote. General view of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana after Katrina hit in 2005 . 'Katrina's IKE was more concentrated, Sandy's IKE was more spread out.

The flooding has killed 442 people, the Interior Ministry said. Of Thailand's 64 provinces, 25 have been affected. Bangkok's central business district is still dry but other parts of the bustling metropolis of 12 million people are inundated. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month. Affected businesses include Hi Tech Industrial Park, where Canon and Sony own assembly plants.

Meshael Alayban, 42, faces one felony count of human trafficking. Court details released Thursday say Alayban is one of the wives of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud. Alayban appeared in an Orange County court in Santa Ana on Thursday, and the judge continued the arraignment until July 29. In the courtroom, Alayban was kept inside a cage-like holding space and spoke with her attorney through the wire webbing. Alayban is being held in the Orange County jail in lieu of $5 million bail. She faces a maximum sentence of 12 years if convicted. Official: Human trafficking probe at Saudi diplomat's home . Police say the servant is a 30-year-old woman, originally from Kenya, who managed to escape Tuesday and flag down a bus. A passenger helped her contact the Irvine Police Department. Investigators say the alleged victim had contracted to work with Alayban's family in Saudi Arabia in March 2012. Her salary was set at $1,600 a month for working eight hours a day, five days a week. But once she arrived in Saudi Arabia, the servant says, her passport was taken from her. She also says she was paid only $220 a month and forced to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. Alayban's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, indicated in a statement, however, that the incident is essentially a labor dispute. Meyer told the court during the bail hearing that \"the police report confirms that there was no physical abuse, no physical restraint, and that the complaints were about hours worked and wages paid,\" according to his statement. \"We intend to fully investigate all facts, and expect that the truth will resolve this matter,\" Meyer's statement said. Police say Alayban's family traveled to the United States in May with the alleged victim and four women from the Philippines under similar contracts. Armed with a search warrant, Irvine detectives and immigration and homeland security agents later found the four other women in the condominium, a news release from police and the Orange County District Attorney's Office says. Police say all five women are in good health, and at this time, there are no indications of physical abuse. This is the first forced labor human trafficking case to be prosecuted in Orange County under California's Proposition 35, which passed in November and increased the penalty for human trafficking.

Marcello Lucero, 37, was stabbed to death in an attack that police say was a hate crime. Jeffrey Conroy, 17, had been charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, one count each of gang assault and conspiracy and two counts each of attempted assault and attempted gang assault. The \"hate crime\" designation would add to any sentence imposed upon conviction. Six teenage co-defendants were arraigned Thursday on the same assault, conspiracy and gang assault charges as Conroy. One of the six faces an additional charge of criminal mischief. Marcello Lucero, 37, was walking to a friend's apartment in Patchogue, New York, when he was attacked late in the evening of November 8, police said. Officers found that he had been stabbed in the chest, and he died of his injuries. A friend with Lucero was not injured. Authorities believe that Conroy stabbed Lucero. His arraignment on the murder charge is scheduled for Monday. The seven youths were trying \"to find Latinos and to assault them,\" Suffolk County Police Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick said at the time. \"That was what they went out to do that night, and that's exactly what they did do. ... They were actively seeking victims,\" he said. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said all seven \"admitted their involvement and their role in this crime. But all seven pleaded not guilty at their initial arraignment November 10. Attorneys for two of the boys told CNN before the unsealing Thursday that their clients are not guilty and disputed the hate crime designation. \"Anthony Hartford had no physical contact with the unfortunate victim who was stabbed,\" attorney Laurence Silverman said. \"My client denies he harbors any ill will toward any person because of race or national origin. My client comes from a mixed background. His great-grandmother was born and raised in Puerto Rico.\" \"Kevin Shea is not guilty,\" attorney Steven M. Politi said. \"The charge that this was a racially motivated crime is inaccurate. ... These are young boys and should enjoy presumption of innocence, and I hope everyone reserves judgment until the facts come out.\" The other defendants are Jordan Dasch, Nicholas Hausch, Christopher Overton and Jose Pacheco. All but Overton, who is 16, are 17 years old. Dasch also faces a charge of criminal mischief.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Jeffrey Conroy, 17, faces count of murder as a hate crime .\\nConroy had been charged with with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime .\\nConroy, six others tried \\\"to find Latinos and to assault them,\\\" police say .\\nMarcello Lucero, 37, and a friend were attacked by a group of teens .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLos Angeles police received an unusual call on Tuesday, after a man reported seeing two women loading a 4ft alligator into a van and driving off. Fearing that the women were planning to abandon the creature in the desert, the retired police officer tailed them as he contacted the authorities. When police pulled the van over the driver admitted to having the alligator, and added that a kangaroo was on board too. Snap shot: Spike the alligator poses on a police car after his owners were pulled over in California . The women explained they were part of the Zoo to You project, which brings exotic creatures to schools. Unfortunately the alligator, named Spike, has soiled his cage on the way back from Quartz Hill Elementary School and the women had pulled over to clean him up. Deputy Michael Rust told the Los Angeles Times that at first he did not believe the call about the exotic animals. 'When I heard it on the radio, I'm thinking, \"Yeah, an alligator. OK\",' he said. 'Maybe an iguana, but an alligator?' Realizing that no creatures were in danger of being harmed, the police took a few 'snaps' of the alligator on their police car, before sending him on his way. Alligators get their heat from sunning themselves on rocks so, as well as enjoying being the center of attention, Spike also made the most of his chance to warm himself on the police car. Partner in crime: When police pulled over the Zoo to You van, the drivers admitted they had a kangaroo too . Restroom break: Zoo to You had pulled over to give Spike the alligator a bathroom break on the way home . In their report, the Los Angeles Police . Department said: 'It seems the alligator forgot to use the restroom . before leaving the school and soiled its cage. This caused the ladies to . stop,' NBC 4 reported. The Zoo to You project in Paso Robles offers permanent homes to abandoned, injured or abused wild and exotic animals, from tigers and alligators, to lizards, porcupines and eagles. Some of the animals are used in their education program and are taken to schools to help teach children about conservation. It is not the first time Spike has been the center of attention. In April he met Jay Leno as he appeared on The Tonight Show. Celebrity status: Jay Leno met Spike the alligator on The Tonight Show in April . Campaign: Zoo to You cares for abandoned exotic animals, and raises awareness about conservation . The talk show host rubbed his belly to send him to sleep on the show, aired on April 5. When Spike was pulled over by police, he was traveling back from an elementary school with Zoo to You's kangaroo. Deputy Rust added: 'We get all kinds of animal calls, from bulls to bears to mountain lions. But I've never heard of an alligator.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Exotic animals were visiting school as part of the Zoo to You project .\\nSpike the alligator had been let out of van after needing a bathroom break .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThe NFL boasts some of the world's most recognisable sportsmen, and now their top stars are being given a makeover to look like characters from TV's most recognisable show. Artist Adrien Noterdaem, who specialises in his depictions of famous faces in the Simpsons style, has come up with a novel idea to celebrate the programme's 25th anniversary. Noterdaem teamed up with Bleacher Report to depict nine of the NFL's biggest stars as characters from the show. Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning has won a superbowl ring and been NFL MVP five times . Jay Cutler has been the Chicago Bears quarterback since 2009 after making the 2008 Pro Bowl at Denver . Three-time Superbowl champion Tom Brady is perhaps the NFL's most famous face at the moment . The NFL season got back underway this month and will conclude with the Superbowl next February . High-profile quarterbacks Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jay Cutler get the yellow treatment, as do younger stars Colin Kaepernick and Robert Green III. The nine-man ensemble does not have much balance, with quarterbacks dominant, but Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch and New Orleans tight end Jimmy Graham also feature. There are also adaptations of two defensive players, Houston's J.J. Watt and Seattle's cornerback Richard Sherman. Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, who is famous for his love of Skittles, also featured . Jimmy Graham is a tight end for the New Orleans Saints and is a two-time Pro Bowler .

Lei Zhang's donation will help pay for a new School of Management campus at Yale and a new auditorium there will bear his name, the school announced last week. He received a master's degree in business from the school in 2002. The gift is the largest ever pledged to the management school. The dollar amount is based on the number eight, which Chinese regard as lucky. Reactions to Lei's gift have ranged from obscenity-laced rants to understanding, according to translated forum comments on chinaSMACK, an aggregator of stories on China's Internet. \"Traitor, were you born with the knowledge you had before going to America?\" one poster asked. \"Why not donate the money to those in China who cannot afford to go to school, the impoverished areas who cannot afford to build schools?\" another wrote before calling Lei a \"double-crossing bastard.\" Others defended Lei's gift. \"Yale helped him achieve his current career and he is gratefully repaying them, we should be pleased,\" a blogger wrote. \"From an objective perspective, who others donate their money to is their personal business, and there is no reason they must donate to China,\" another wrote. Part of Lei's gift will help provide scholarships for Chinese students in the International Relations Program at the school's new Jackson Institute of Global Affairs, Yale said in a statement. The money also will support China-related activities at the university, including a program in cooperation with China's Ministry of Education to train Chinese university presidents. A poll question on chinaSMACK asked: \"What do you think about Chinese graduates donating large sums of money to Yale?\" Of the nearly 45,000 votes that the Web site said it attracted, nearly 49 percent indicated that there is nothing wrong with Lei's gift, while 39.5 percent indicated that he should have first donated money to his own country's education. More than 11 percent were undecided. Lei is the founder and managing partner of Hillhouse Capital Management, a Beijing-based investment fund overseeing an estimated $2.5 billion.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Gift is the largest ever pledged to Yale's management school .\\nPart of Lei's gift will help provide scholarships for Chinese students, Yale says .\\nNearly 49 percent of votes indicated there is nothing wrong with Lei's gift .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Costa Rican officials surveyed damage Wednesday after a major earthquake rattled the country's northwest coast. The 7.6-magnitude quake was \"one of the strongest earthquakes\" ever to hit the Central American nation, President Laura Chinchilla said. The president praised residents' response, saying there were no reports of major physical damage from the quake. \"Costa Ricans knew how to react,\" she said. The quake struck Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula Wednesday morning, on the Pacific coast about 87 miles west of the capital, San Jose. It was centered more than 28 miles deep. Schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed Thursday and Friday while engineers inspect buildings for damage, Chinchilla said. Officials gave conflicting reports about whether anyone had been killed. Late Wednesday Chinchilla said there were \"no human losses,\" but earlier emergency officials said at least one person had died from a heart attack suffered during the quake. \"It started out pretty mild, but then it really got going,\" said Bill Root, owner of a hotel in Samara, also near the epicenter. \"It was a very strong earthquake. Everything was falling off the shelves and the ground was rolling.\" Costa Rica's National Emergency Commission reported debris on roads, electrical outages and some structural damage in homes, especially on the Nicoya Peninsula, about 14 kilometers (8 miles) from the epicenter. Red Cross ambulances evacuated patients from two damaged hospitals, said Enrique Guevara, a spokesman for the Red Cross in the Americas. Hours after the quake, authorities canceled all tsunami warnings and watches. CNN affiliate Teletica showed people streaming out of buildings when the earthquake hit. Telephone service was knocked out in cities near the epicenter, Teletica reported. The station showed photos submitted by viewers of a partially collapsed bridge over the Rio Sucio and a landslide on a highway. Other photos showed floors littered with merchandise inside stores and homes with minor damages. \"It's unnerving when solid concrete beneath you is shaking from side to side. It was pretty scary,\" said David Boddinger, editor of the English-language Tico Times in San Jose. Seismologists have been predicting a strong quake in that area for years now, and Costa Ricans were wondering if this was the big one, he said. CNN's Catherine E.

Yemeni state television broadcast footage of the president's meeting with John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser. The two met at a military hospital in Riyadh, where Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been recovering since he was wounded in the attack on his presidential compound more than a month ago. Video of the meeting shows Saleh wearing a suit jacket, his face still singed from the June 3 blast. Brennan wished Saleh \"a speedy recovery\" but also \"emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa,\" the White House said in a statement on Sunday's meeting. He urged Saleh to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council's political transition plan for Yemen. \"The United States believes that a transition in Yemen should begin immediately so that the Yemeni people can realize their aspirations,\" the White House statement said. Saleh has voiced agreement with the plan by the GCC, which would ensure his gradual departure from office, but he has not signed it. Saleh told Brennan that the GCC initiative laid the groundwork for exiting the political crisis through national dialogue involving all political parties, Yemen's state-run Saba news agency reported. As Brennan and Saleh met in Saudi Arabia, clashes erupted between government security forces and armed tribesmen in one of the epicenters of Yemen's anti-government movement. Two people were killed and at least nine others were injured in the southwestern Yemeni city of Taiz Sunday, medical sources in the city said. Dozens of homes were also damaged in the fighting, which started early Sunday morning and stretched for more than eight hours, witnesses said. Saleh appeared on television in Yemen Thursday for the first time since the attack, telling viewers he was on the mend, open to talks with opposition forces and determined to strike back at his attackers. His speech from Saudia Arabia transfixed his home country, which has been enduring months of anti-government protests and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militant activity. Saleh said he had had eight successful surgeries in Saudi Arabia, but the president, whose badly burned face was dark and who sat stiffly upright in a buttoned-up robe, didn't specify when he would go back to Yemen -- a return his supporters anticipate but his opponents hope will never occur. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. On Sunday, Saleh thanked Brennan for U.S. support of \"Yemen's unity, security and stability,\" according to Saba. \"He confirmed that Yemen needs to be supported and assisted to promote economic and development fields so as to reduce poverty and unemployment, which represent a fertile environment of terrorism,\" Saba reported.

Chris Parsons . PUBLISHED: . 03:45 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:37 EST, 30 April 2012 . Staff on P&O cruise ships paid just 75p an hour are having their tips withheld unless they reach certain performance targets, it was reported today. In a move designed to make crew 'more responsive', staff are having their bonuses cut unless their work matches pre-agreed customer feedback ratings, some of which are more than 96 per cent. The extreme end of the scale sees junior waiters on a cruise from Southampton earning just £250 a month, with a possible £150 in bonuses, according to the Guardian. Pay package: Crewmembers on P&O ships will have their bonuses withheld unless they meet certain performance targets . Documents seen by the newspaper claim this pay, for 11-hour shifts, seven days a week, represents a 'significantly increased basic salary'. David Dingle, CEO of Carnival UK, the firm in charge of P&O cruises, told the Guardian that customers were 'reluctant to pay the recommended level of tipping', claiming the move had made crew 'much happier.' He said: 'You've got staff from eastern Europe in restaurants in Britain – why? Because it's great money. 'Yes, the minimum wage is more than we pay, but this is a global industry, Our businesses have to remain competitive. P&O boss DAvid Dingle defended the pay move, saying it has made crew 'much happier' 'Let's not forget the level of take-home pay for our staff, the vast majority of whom come from India. Look at hotels in Goa. The earning ability is greater on our ships.' Many restaurants have already phased out cash tipping in favour of electronic tips which are automatically added to customers' bills. However, P&O bosses have opted to remove the risk of tips not being paid by paying bonuses if targets are met.

Drogba is contemplating a big challenge by the Ivory Coast in South Africa. The Chelsea striker scored the decisive goal as the Elephants sealed their place in South Africa with a 1-1 draw against Malawi on Saturday, but he is now looking ahead to the finals with relish. \"It is going to be a challenge,\" the 31-year-old told reporters. \"To make it to the final will not be easy because there are great teams like Brazil and Germany who have won the World Cup for many years. \"But my teammates and I want to make history and want to change the way the world sees African football. Can an African team win the World Cup next year ? \"I hope that we'll be the team that is going to go to the final and win the competition.\" Ivory Coast have joined Ghana as definite qualifiers from Africa, with three other places up for grabs in the final round of matches in November. Drogba is one of several stars in the Ivorian squad with Champions League experience, including Barcelona's Yaya Toure who is anxious to erase memories of their failure to qualify from the group stages in the 2006 finals in Germany. \"At the last World Cup we played really well in Germany, but we were unlucky because we were in a very tough group with Argentina and Holland and so went out in the first round,\" he said. \"But I think with this kind of experience, it will be possible at South Africa 2010 to do much better. Perhaps we can make the quarterfinals and then semifinals, this is something we can achieve.\" Coach Vahid Halilhodzic is also upbeat after seeing his side fight back from a goal down against Malawi to top African Group E. \"We are very proud to participate in the World Cup for the second consecutive time and this time it is going to be better,\" he added.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Didier Drogba targets World Cup glory with African powerhouses Ivory Coast .\\nDrogba scored crucial goal as Ivory Coast clinched qualification for South Africa .\\nIvory Coast exited in group stages at the World Cup finals in Germany in 2006 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nFormer Hull KR boss Craig Sandercock is back in the NRL as Rick Stone's assistant at Newcastle .

A great grandfather was knocked down and killed by a car wash worker - after taking his vehicle in for a clean, a court heard. Retired butcher Dave Fields, 75, had taken his car in for its regular wash at Cwmbran Car Wash when he was hit by one of the employees. The pensioner was watching his car being washed when learner driver Sokol Muja, 27, reversed a people carrier into him. A court heard how Mr Fields was knocked to ground on the car wash forecourt where he hit his head and died. Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'Mr Fields became aware of a Chrysler Voyager reversing in his direction and CCTV footage showed saw him back-pedalling in an attempt to avoid the vehicle. 'He was seen holding out his walking stick to shield himself but the rear of the vehicle hit him and he fell on the back of his head.' Great-grandfather Mr Fields, described as the anchor of his large family, remained conscious but his condition worsened in hospital and he died five days later. Mr Fields' daughter-in-law Kathy told the court in an impact statement: 'He was a very special man who was much loved by his family and the community. 'The family will never get over the tragic way he died. Without him we are all lost. Our whole World has been turned upside down and we have lost the anchor to our family. 'He was a real family man who touched many hearts and will be dearly missed.' Muja, who had been learning to drive at the time of the accident, was quizzed by police after the collision. He claimed he had not seen Mr Fields when he knocked him down at the car wash owned by his brother on the Llantarnam Industrial Estate at Cwmbran, South Wales. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate . Cardiff Crown Court heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate. She handed Muja, who also admitted driving without insurance and in accordance with the provisional licence he holds, a six month suspended sentence. He was banned from driving for two years. Judge Rees also ordered Muja to undertake 250 hours of community work and told to pay £350 in costs and victim surcharge. She told Muja, from Cwmbran: 'Your action resulted in a tragic and needless loss of life and you will have to bear the burden of guilt throughout your life.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Dave Fields, 75, was run over on the forecourt of Cwmbran Car Wash .\\nLearner driver Sokol Muja claims he didn't see Mr Fields before he reversed .\\nHe was handed a six month suspended sentence and two year driving ban .\\nJudge Rees has also urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Economists pore over central bank interest rate decisions, key retail numbers and consumer confidence figures for signs of economic health -- but could road toll collections also carry clues for the future? Academics at Germany's Institute for the Study of Labor, based in Bonn, believe they can. They have developed a system, called the Toll Index, to tap road toll data for indications of industrial production in Europe's biggest economy. \"Toll collectors use it to bill people, to finance our roads. We use it usefully to solve early forecasting problems,\" Klaus Zimmermann, one of the institute's directors, told CNN. Most heavy vehicles in Germany carry GPS technology which links to a satellite system for collecting road tolls. The data -- which calculates the number of trips made across borders -- is then used by Zimmerman's team for economic forecasting. DSV head Jens Bjorn Andersen, one of Europe's biggest transport companies, points out the industry is one of the first to feel the brunt of an economic downturn. The industry suffers if consumers cut back on spending, because there is less need to transport goods. Transportation was hit by a rapid drop in volumes after the third quarter of 2008, as the global slump kicked in, Andersen said. \"The downturn in the whole world economy was probably seen first in transport companies,\" he added. Driving a truck through Europe's debt crisis . According to Zimmermann, the transportation industry is able to give analysts a quick status check on the economy, rather than having to wait weeks or months for official data to be released. \"[It's] the first forecast of the economy which is actually better than existing economic indicators,\" he said. Nikolaus Askitas, the institute's chief technology officer, said they considered exploring river and rail transport for economic indicators but the trucking industry provided the best data. \"[How do you] bring the product from the production site to the harbor or to the railway station? By trucks,\" said Askitas. The Toll Index still has some kinks, such as inability to differentiate between trucks which are carrying goods for export and those which are not. But its developers argue the speed of its data analysis delivers an insight into market movements as they are happening.

I'm very honest about that. I love being recognized, I love people liking me, I love the fact that people scream when I go out. I think I'll miss all that when it's taken away,\" he told CNN. But earlier this year comments by Khan, the owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders, caused a storm of controversy and attention he didn't want. Khan questioned the lack of Pakistani players in this year's competition, and Indian Hindu nationalist party Shiv Sena interpreted the comments as inflammatory. Threats were made to boycott his latest film and some activists made some threats against him and his family's safety. \"It just went onto a political agenda platform, onto an activist platform. I'm not on the same playing field. I'm an actor, I'm not a politician,\" he said. \"This was my point of view... it wasn't as if I was saying something new. I didn't know it would cause so much trouble, and especially when a film was releasing, you don't want that kind of trouble. It just went completely through the roof.\" Khan is keen to keep his roles as an actor, cricket team boss and icon for millions as far from the political realm as possible. His face is one of the most salable in India with his image used in a raft of adverts and supporting products. Yet his recent film \"My Name is Khan\" did touch upon religious sensitivities, striking a chord among cinema goers in Muslim countries across the world. In the film Khan, himself a Muslim, plays an autistic Muslim immigrant in American soon after the terrorists attack on September 11, 2001. \"I really thought the film was about humanity. It's not about Islam, it could have been about any religion to be honest,\" he said. \"But I simply thought we made a film about humanity.

Burger addict: Randall W Miller, 31, led police officers on a car chase because he wanted to 'finish his Big Mac' An Ohio man who nearly hit a pedestrian took police officers on a car chase out of a McDonald’s drive-through because he wanted to ‘finish his Big Mac’. The 31-year-old Randall W Miller, from Hinckley, was chased by Brunswick police after a pedestrian reported that an SUV was speeding and nearly hit him at an intersection on September 28. Police found the SUV exiting a McDonald’s drive-thru near Center Road, swerving outside his lane. They attempted to stop Miller, but he continued driving, eventually stopping a short while later at Grafton Road, according to Fox 8. According to police, Miller apologised saying he was too drunk and wanted to eat his Big Mac burger before stopping. He continued to eat the sandwich during the stop until he was asked to complete field sobriety tests. Police said Miller admitted to drinking 10 to 15 beers and added that it ‘wasn’t worth the trouble’. Big Mac: The driver refused to pull over until he could finish his burger . Car chase: Police officers drove after Miller when he came out of a McDonald's drive-through in Brunswick, Ohio, on September 28 . A breathalyser test showed that Miller had a blood alcohol content level of .255, which is more than three times the legal limit in Ohio. Police officers also said they found an open beer and several beer cans in the car. Miller was cited and faces charges for failure to comply, operating a vehicle while intoxicated, driving under suspension and no operator’s license.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Randall W Miller, 31, from Hinckley, almost hit a pedestrian while speeding .\\nPolice officers chased him out of the drive-through in Brunswick .\\nHe stopped further down the road saying he kept driving because he wanted to finish his burger .\\nMiller had an alcohol content level three times the limit .\\nPolice said he admitted to drinking between 10 and 15 beers .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- The family of a Georgia student suspended for the rest of the school year for hugging a teacher has filed an appeal with the school board, the teen's mother told CNN on Wednesday night. Sam McNair, a 17-year-old high school senior in Duluth, Georgia, was suspended December 3 for sexual harassment. Surveillance video captured the hug in question, showing Sam placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug. The teacher then pushes him away. McNair told \"Piers Morgan Live\" that he had hugged that teacher at Duluth High School before. \"Four or five times,\" he said. \"I hug all my teachers. It's to show appreciation for what they do for me.\" He denied that the teacher had told him before to not hug her again. He also said that his lips and cheeks definitely didn't touched the teacher's neck, as is alleged in a discipline report obtained by CNN affiliate WGCL. In a statement earlier this week, Sloan Roach, a spokesperson for the Gwinnett County Public Schools, told CNN, \"Hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary history -- including long-term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences.\" \"If a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel, he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the Gwinnett County Board of Education,\" Roach added. Since this is a discipline issue, the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student's situation or the student's past discipline history, said the spokeswoman. McNair acknowledged he had also been suspended for lengthy periods in the seventh and ninth grades, but said the first incident was from a BB gun that another student placed in his bag, and the second stemmed from medicine a teammate gave him for an injury. He had a bad reaction and it caused a \"big school disruption,\" he said. April McNair, Sam's mother, said she was never notified that her son's behavior this year was a problem. \"Sam is a lovable kid,\" she said, adding that he treated everyone that way. She said an appeal was sent Wednesday to the school board. She remains concerned this will negatively impact her son's future. \"This is his senior year,\" April McNair said. \"You've stripped that of him.\" Sam McNair said he is more cautious about he now greets people and if they seem hesitant he passes on the hug. \"I make sure I present myself as a gentleman,\" he said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Mother says an appeal filed Wednesday .\\nSam McNair, a senior, was suspended for sexual harassment .\\nHe says he has never been told not to hug that teacher .\\nMother says she was never told that her son's behavior was a problem .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Not content with raising energy costs, suppliers are now making it difficult and expensive for customers to speak to them. Those phoning about bills and services are facing a long wait, according to a study, with some firms keeping them on hold for up to almost 47 minutes. And these calls are also generating unnecessary telephone bills for customer. Frustrating: Power firms keep customers waiting for up to 47 minutes, research has found (library image) Recent price rises have caused a surge in callers wanting to change their tariff or move to a rival energy firm. But firms have failed to ensure their call centres have sufficient staff to deal with them. Research by Which? found that the average wait for a customer to speak to a real person has increased over the past six months. On average 14 out of the 16 energy companies called left researchers on hold for longer than they did when the same test was carried out in April. A spokesman said: ‘Our latest research found that the longest average waiting time went up from 17 minutes 5 seconds to over 25 minutes.’ Scottish Power had the worst single example of keeping a customer on hold, with a delay of 46 minutes and 49 seconds. Its average delay before a call was answered by a human being was two seconds short of 19 minutes. Npower, which has the highest standard tariff of the Big Six energy companies at just under £1,500 a year, had the longest average delay of 19 minutes and 14 seconds – two minutes and nine seconds longer than in April. The longest average waiting time was with the small company First Utility, where it rose from six minutes and 13 seconds to 25 minutes and 10 seconds. Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, said: ‘With trust in the industry already at rock bottom and consumers being hit by the latest round of price hikes, it’s time the energy companies started putting their customers first.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Study shows some firms are keeping customers waiting for up to 47 minutes .\\nResearch found average waiting time increased over last six months .\\nRise in energy prices seen a surge in callers wishing to change their tariff .\\nBut study by Which? shows firms failed to increase staff numbers .\\nFirst Utility and Npower have among the worst average waiting times .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThis heartwarming video shows the moment a young boy was told he was going to become a big brother for the first time. 10-year-old Ethan was handed a Christmas card by his parents - only to discover that it was no ordinary festive gift.

The video, which has been posted on YouTube, shows Ethan about to open an early Christmas card - but baffled as to why he is being filmed. The card says 'To a wonderful brother' on the front, and has an ultrasound photograph inside, although Ethan does not seem initially to work out exactly what is going on. Joy: Ethan sees an ultrasound picture of his new sibling (left), and starts crying when he realises exactly what his parents are trying to tell him .

The rare arrival took place at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra province, making Indonesia the third country to have successfully bred the species in captivity. There are less than 200 Sumatran rhinos remaining in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), making it the most endangered of all rhino species. Aside from a dozen or so in Malaysia's Sabah province, the Sumatran rhinos reside in three national parks in Indonesia. The critical endangered species is most threatened by poaching for its horns and destruction of its natural habitat. These factors have contributed to an estimated reduction in its numbers of more than 50% over the last two decades, the IRF said. The father of Indonesia's newborn calf is actually one of three Sumatran Rhinos bred in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in the United States. Andalus was born in 2001, some 112 years after the first known captive birth at Calcutta Zoo in India in 1889. Saturday's birth was welcomed by rhino conservationists, following two miscarriages by Andalas' partner, Ratu, since their pairing in 2009. \"It's really a big present for the Sumatran rhino breeding efforts as we know that this is a very rare species which have some difficulties in their reproduction,\" Masyhud, a forestry ministry spokesman, told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France Presse.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Sumatran rhino born in Indonesia, the fifth known to have been born in captivity ever .\\nIndonesia is now the third country to have successfully bred the species in captivity .\\nLess than 200 Sumatran rhinos remain in the world, making it the most endangered of all rhino species .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nDavos, Switzerland (CNN) -- LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to \"digital hippies\" as a potential theme for his next conference. The French entrepreneur runs the biggest tech gathering in Europe and he's cautious to firm up a tagline too early. But when CNN caught up with him at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which he has attended for 11 years, he revealed what's on his mind. Why Davos matters in social media age . Le Meur is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money, fame and power -- they just want to be happy. They are digital hippies. Taking inspiration from events such as Nevada's art and music festival \"Burning Man,\" which he attended for the first time in 2012, Le Meur told CNN digital hippies are: \"Vegan, they don't drink alcohol, they want to know where their food comes from, they are trying to go slow when we are going fast.\" He referenced Apple's Steve Jobs and Virgin's Richard Branson as examples of those who began business as digital hippies. Digital hippies are creating a sharing economy -- one that includes creations like Wikipedia, Airbnb and Lyft -- without a focus on exchanging cash. At Burning Man, Le Meur \"took $500 and came back with $500.\" The event, packed full of successful entrepreneurs, changed how he saw the world, Le Meur said. \"It is a little crazy.\" Trump: Europe is open for business . Le Meur said the theme may be a bit risky, and he's a \"little scared\" it will scare his sponsors. Although \"Peace, Tech and Love\" seems a good tag, he added. Digital hippies are not the only trend on his radar. The return of hardware is another. In the world of apps, hardware can be unattractive for investors. But Le Meur points to the ability of hardware creations to entirely disrupt supply chains. \"We build websites, then apps, and now we are back to hardware,\" Le Meur said. 3-D printing, for example, could revolutionize the way we buy products. \"You need a knife and fork? You can print it. A glass? You can print it.\" Davos, a gathering of the world's elite, could not be further from the idea of digital hippies, but it serves an important role, Le Meur says. \"It is the only place you can meet so many stakeholders. Instead of reading or watching the news you are in the news,\" he says. \"I take out of it a lot of innovation, a lot of ideas, that you can use. But I don't come here with a specific goal. I come here very curious and try to learn.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to \\\"digital hippies\\\" as a potential theme for his next conference .\\nLe Meur is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money, fame and power .\\nDigital hippies are not the only trend on his radar.

A dramatic 9-8 penalty shootout alleviated a turgid scoreless draw, but after a 23-year wait Ivory Coast will not care how they secured the silverware. The unlikely hero of the evening was Boubacar Barry, Ivory Coast's hitherto reserve goalkeeper, only promoted to the team after an injury side-lined first choice Sylvain Gbohouo. After saving two penalties, he slotted the winning kick against his opposite number, sending the West African nation into raptures. It was a bizarre and beguiling night of football in Equatorial Guinea, but the festivities were not contained to the Estadio de Bata. Millions around the world, including players past and present, took to social media to share their despair and jubilation. Here, we have compiled the juiciest online outbursts as we reflect on this, the morning after the night before. The importance of the occasion could not be understated. But an utterly uncompelling 120 minutes of football gifted few highlights. Fans were impatient. As open play drew to a close the painful inevitability of penalties awaited. Ivory Coast's Gervinho, subbed in the dying moments of extra time and knowing he would play no further part, couldn't bring himself to watch the shootout. Sitting despondently in a plastic chair, the internet turned on the Ivorian striker and reacted in the only way it knows how: a meme. Both teams missed two penalties apiece, calling forth the dreaded sudden death. With the late drama, all was forgiven according to ESPN. Neutrals reveled in the late drama. With all outfield players having stepped up, it was down to the goalkeepers. Tom Gann was at hand to provide a Marxist reading of the situation. As Boubacar Barry broke the deadlock, Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba reacted to the moment. With the help of The Simpson's Jasper Beardly, one parody account summed by the absurdity of the situation. Wyclef Jean of The Fugees was quick to offer both his congratulations and commiserations. Ghanaian recording artist M.anifest was despairing. The post-match analysis was swift and cutting, some suggesting the Ghanaians could have done with a little more training and a little less of this: . The Black Cats' John Mensah was magnanimous in defeat... ...And the hero Boubacar Barry was humble in victory. There were consequences for ex-Ghana player Samuel Kuffour, who bet his team would win. Ivory Coast' Salomon Kalou pointed to the long path he and his captain Yaya Toure had taken to victory. And fans felt the same. But after 23 years of hurt, the journey was complete.

The daughter of Mary Ann Murphy, 48, is accused of taking part in the stabbing of her mother on July 16. Now Rebecca Renee Keller, 20, from Houston, Texas has also been charged with murder and court records claim she had a sexual encounter with the daughter around the time of the slaying. Accused: Rebecca Renee Keller (left), 20, and Zein Imran Ahmed (right), 21, have been charged with the murder of Mary Ann Murphy in Houston, Texas . Keller has also been charged with the sexual assault of a child. A friend of the daughter, Zein Imran Ahmed, 21, has also been charged with the murder at Mrs Murphy's home in the 8300 block of Poplar Ridge Lane, according to my fox houston. While her mother was being murdered, her daughter ran into a neighbor's home and told them that someone was attacking her mother. 'She said her mom was screaming loud, and I did think I heard a scream but I didn't know for sure,' Marcus Cox, the neighbor, said that morning. 'I just thought it was some kids down the street.' When police first went to the home of Murphy, her daughter said that two men had forced their way into the home when they were in bed and murdered her mother before fleeing the scene. It was just days before detectives realized it was a fabricated story and arrested the 48-year-old's daughter and Ahmed, after the knife used in the brutal stabbing was found at his home just blocks away. Scene: Mary Ann Murphy was stabbed to death on July 16 at her home in the 8300 block of Poplar Ridge Lane . Prosecutors said Ahmed admitted slipping into Murphy's bedroom with her daughter's permission. He allegedly got on top of the woman and began stabbing her when she woke up.

It is the latest in a series of protests by Sunni Arabs who claim to be marginalised by the Shia-led government. Fighting broke out on Thursday after army troops disbanded a Sunni protest camp in nearby capital of the Levant province, Ramadi. Response: The Iraqi army is surrounding Fallujah, and has deployed tanks and artillery ahead of an all-out military assault to retake the city . Iraqi troops and allied tribesmen surrounded the city on Wednesday, firing artillery at up to 150 militants, an anonymous military official said. On Saturday, police abandoned the city and have now taken up posts on the outskirts to prevent the fighters roaming further. Hadi Razeij, head of the Anbar police force, told Arabic language broadcaster al-Arabiya: 'The walls of the city are in the hands of the police force, but the people of Fallujah are the prisoners of ISIL.' Fallujah and Ramadi were strongholds of Sunni insurgents during the US-led war. In a speech in Baghdad, prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said government forces would press on to clear the province of militants. 'There will be no retreat until we eliminate this gang and rid the people of Anbar of their evil acts,' he said. Sunni Muslim worshippers crowded streets in the city west of Baghdad after violence in nearby Ramadi . 'The people of Anbar asked the government for help, they called us to come to rescue them from terrorists.' Anger was exacerbated over the past week after authorities arrested a senior Sunni politician and dismantled a months-old sit-in in Ramadi. In an attempt to calm the situation, al-Maliki pulled some military out to give local police security duties - a top demand of Sunnis. But after the uprising, the military rushed reinforcements back in - a move supported by allied Sunni tribal fighters. Government official Dhari al-Rishawi said clashes - some of the worst in five years - were still underway, adding militants remain in control of Fallujah and some parts of Ramadi, Anbar's capital.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Police have abandoned city of Fallujah as militants take control .\\nAl Qaeda-linked fighters also in charge of provincial capital Ramadi .\\nStems from Sunni protests at being marginalised by Shia-led government .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nTottenham have announced their double-winning left-back Ron Henry has died aged 80.

At least 15 people were wounded in Friday's unrest, part of ongoing violence in this area of the country, the United Nations said. The United Nations called for an immediate end to fighting between the Bafuliru and Barundi/Banyamulenge communities in the province of South Kivu. Martin Kobler, the chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said troops would be deployed to Mutarule to assist the Congolese army and local officials. Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region, has been at the center of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda, for two decades. Government troops have also battled rebel groups such as M23, which was defeated in November. The persistent violence has led to thousands of families who cannot farm and leave their homes for refugee camps, according to the United Nations. The international body also blames a lack of government spending on agriculture, education, health and infrastructure for the worsening situation.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The United Nations sends in peacekeepers after 30 people are killed .\\nThe fighting was between two communities of Congolese .\\nEastern Congo has long been the center of ethnic and political conflict .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . When the English obsession with Andrea Pirlo turns to the ‘panenka’ penalty he scored against Joe Hart at Euro 2012, England’s keeper can’t remember a thing. Perhaps it is better that way. It was in Kiev, with England leading 2-1 in the shoot-out at the Donbass Arena, when Hart raised his arms and stuck his tongue out at the Italian as he took aim from 12 yards. Hart guessed to his right and the great Italian clipped his penalty down the centre of the goal. Soon enough, England were heading home. ‘I’ll never regret how it was, I saw it as the best way for us to win the shoot-out,’ said Hart. Cheeky: Andrea Pirlo executes a clever chipped 'panenka' penalty over Joe Hart at Euro 2012 . Life through a lens: Hart leads his team-mates as England arrive at their hotal in Manaus before re-facing Italy . ‘I don’t think there was personal vengeance from him and there certainly wasn’t any from me. He did what he thought he needed to do for his country and I did what I thought was best for mine. 'I couldn’t even tell you what I did. But it felt right at the time. It obviously wasn’t.’ Now a two-time Premier League winner with Manchester City, these are good times for Hart, 27, and he has come to appreciate the demands of playing at the highest level. ‘I want to do well for this team and this nation,’ he added. ‘A lot of time and effort has gone into it and the more you’re involved the more you realise that it is more than football. It means an awful lot to a lot of people. Through his paces: Hart trains at the Urca military base in preparation for the ultimate test against Italy . 'A lot of money has been invested and a lot of time and care, from me personally, has gone into this. I want to make it all worthwhile.’ At the last World Cup, in South Africa, Hart became increasingly irritated with the Italian coaching staff who appeared to be calling him ‘John’. Fabio Capello was the main culprit and Hart admitted: ‘I did take offence about that, but I’ve calmed down. Since then I’ve been called “John” by a lot of Italians who know me — I think it’s just how they talk. It was just a mispronunciation.’ Loggerheads: Hart (second left) admits frustration over his relationship with ex-boss Fabio Capello (left) A goalkeeper’s life is a fragile one and there have been times this season when City’s keeper has been under fire. But he finished the campaign well, and added: ‘It means a lot to have your club and country behind you. ‘I’ve got to keep working hard because potentially I could go through another bad patch again.’\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Joe Hart has no regrets over the Euro 2012 penalty shoot-out .\\nEngland keeper wants to make all the World Cup preparation worthwhile .\\nHart became irritated at Fabio Capello's staff calling him 'John'\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

The influx of athletes and spectators during the Games, which run from July 28 to August 12, is expected to push the capital's infrastructure to near breaking point. But 'normal' visitors are staying away from London this summer because of concerns over congestion. This has resulted in hotels slashing . their prices to as little as £10 a night the weekend after the Olympic . party comes to a close. Ghost town: Tourism bosses fear London will be left deserted in the weeks immediately following the Olympic Games . One hotel adjacent to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, is offering a £39 rate for a family of four on Friday August 17, reports the Independent. The hotel, a new-build Premier Inn, is charging £199 per night during the Olympics. But while it is to be expected for hotel prices in and around the Olympic site to slump considerably following the Games, the same pattern is occurring in central London as well. The Travelodge in Covent Garden is charging £170 for a twin room on Friday August 10 - one week later and this price has shrunk to just £42.75. Elsewhere, the Savoy offers its Signature River 1-Bed Suite King for £5,750 on August 10; a week later it costs 'just' £2,195, a saving of more than £3,500. Bargain: Adjacent to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, this Premier Inn is offering a £39 rate for a family of four on Friday August 17 . Nick Varney, chief executive of attractions operator Merlin, said: 'The travel trade who normally bring tourist groups have basically switched away from London. 'Hotel rooms have gone up in price, and they've thought, \"We don't even want to deal with being in London through that summer period.\" So immediately, there's a trade hit.' Kit Malthouse, London's deputy mayor, said that a slump in tourism is to be expected in the aftermath of hosting the Olympics.He said: 'After the Games, there will be an exaggerated effect of people staying away because they're uncertain about what state the city is in.' However, the effect is expected to be short-lived as the Paralympic Games start on August 29 and run until September 9.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"'Normal' visitors are staying away from London this summer because of concerns over congestion .\\nHotels have slashed prices to as little as £10 a night weekend after Games ends .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA California property that once belonged to Walt Disney was sold for $74million.

The controller has been suspended, pending an investigation, for watching a movie on a portable electronic device while he was working at the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center in Oberlin, Ohio. His front-line manager, who was aware of it and didn't stop him, also was suspended, LaHood confirmed. The incident occurred early Sunday morning, when the audio from the Samuel L. Jackson thriller \"Cleaner\" was transmitted over a radio frequency for more than three minutes. \"The problem was brought to air traffic control's attention by the pilot of a military aircraft using an alternate frequency,\" according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration. FAA policy prohibits the use of portable DVD players and other devices from being used in radar rooms. Stories of derelict controllers keep piling up, even as the head of the FAA and the leader of the controllers' union started a cross-country tour to spread the gospel of professionalism to the rank and file. There have now been incidents in Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; Reno, Nevada; Seattle; Lubbock, Texas; and Miami in just the past couple of months. Scheduling rules have been adjusted and staffing beefed up to mitigate fatigue among controllers, but in the Ohio incident, fatigue does not appear to have been the issue. Personal responsibility \"really needs to become much more part of our training,\" LaHood told CNN, \"much more of what our (FAA) administrator says to controllers as he travels the country and meets with them. \"I meet with controllers a lot, too, when I travel the country. I visit air traffic control towers and I guarantee it will be part of my message.\" Pressed to explain why such incidents keep happening in spite of officials' insistence that the situation will not be tolerated, LaHood said, \"Well, it won't be.\" \"We've done some things here in the short term like extending rest time from eight to nine hours. We've moved supervisors into positions where we think it's more important to have more supervisors,\" \"And we will continue to do what we have to do to make sure the controllers understand they have to take personal responsibility for this most important safety job they have,\" he said,.

Neighbors told reporters the house had has issues for years, but with the latest revelation authorities are calling it the site of the worst case of animal abuse they've ever seen in Vacaville. But self-described cat activist Katherine Gerrard says she was saving the cats. Scroll down for video . Complaints about the horrible smell wafting from one California home led animal control to the grim discovery of more than 100 cats kept in filth . 'All the cats are healthy and they’re fine,' she told a CBS13 reporter through her shut front door. 'They were being transported somewhere.' She claims she was taking them to shelters. The cats remain in the custody of animal control as evidence. 'Her belief is that she was doing the right thing,' said animal services officer Mark Schwarz. He said the house was filled with litter boxes, and a smell so terrible he needed a mask to breath inside. The smell lingers even with the animals removed, but Gerrard claims the cats sprayed because they were startled by the authorities . 'When we talked with her, she basically said that she couldn’t smell anything, and nothing was wrong,' he said. Neighbor Luke Curry said the odor from the cats was overpowering.

Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano, here last week in San Pedro, California, wants to replace the Real ID. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week said she is working with governors to repeal the Real ID Act, which was passed in 2005 and went into effect last year. The bill is popular in Washington, but is scorned by many governors who bear the responsibility and cost of validating that holders of driver's licenses are citizens or legal residents of the United States. Napolitano, former governor of Arizona, said she has met with governors of both parties recently \"to look at a way to repeal Real ID.\" She said she wants to substitute the federal law with \"something else that pivots off of the driver's license but accomplishes some of the same goals. And we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon.\" Napolitano made her remarks Tuesday in response to a question at a conference of the Anti-Defamation League. On Wednesday, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, a sponsor of the law, said he was \"angered\" by Napolitano's comments. \"Real ID is a necessary program for keeping America safe. It is the will of Congress and also a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission,\" Sensenbrenner said. \"When the Democrats took over the majority in the 110th Congress, they said they wanted to implement all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. I am highly disappointed that they are going back on their word by repealing this important recommendation, and substituting it with a weaker, less safe program that provides terrorists with too many avenues to attack.\" While Napolitano is looking for ways to repeal Real ID, her department's Web site continues to espouse the law's merits. \"Raising the standards of state-issued identification is an important step toward enhancing national security,\" the Web site says. \"Because a driver's license serves so many purposes [access to federal buildings, nuclear power plants, boarding aircraft, etc.], terrorists actively seek fraudulent state-issued identification. The Real ID rules will make it more difficult for them, while making it easier for law enforcement to detect falsified documents,\" it says. The law, which requires all states to enforce specific identification requirements for driver's licenses and identification cards, went into effect last year, but the federal government has given states until the end of this year to implement it. States can get extensions until May 2011 for implementation if they meet certain benchmarks.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she's meeting with governors .\\nAgency chief says a substitute is needed that accomplishes \\\"same goals\\\"\\nRepublican sponsor of law says Real ID is necessary \\\"for keeping America safe\\\"\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

The Chief Whip is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10. Mr Gove, who was sacked as Education Secretary last year, defended the use of the car insisting it would be carrying classified government papers even if he is not sat on the back seat . Chief Whip Michael Gove is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10 . Mr Gove was captured by the Daily Mirror taking just 73 seconds to travel 440 yards in his silver Jaguar from Parliament to Downing Street. Many Cabinet ministers arrive in Downing Street on foot, after the coalition cut the budget for ministerial cars. But Mr Gove is frequently seen stepping out of his car, often clutching newspapers and coffee cups. Labour MP Grahame Morris told the Mirror: 'The Tories preach austerity while wasting taxpayers' cash. Seeing Michael Gove use his chauffeur-driven car, even if he's only going down the road, shows they revel in the trappings of office while others struggle to make ends meet.' But a spokesman for Mr Gove said that he was simply following 'standard Cabinet Office protocol' for ministers when they are carrying sensitive official papers. 'This is a total non-story. As Chief Whip, Michael Gove carries sensitive papers and the rules are these have to be transported securely,' the spokesman said. 'Government cars often make short journeys like this to transport papers even if there is no minister in them. The Chief Whip has followed the standard Cabinet Office protocol and will continue to do so.' Mr Gove, left, regularly uses the his car to travel to and from the House of Commons where he is often to be seen sitting on the government frontbench . A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'On each of these occasions, the car contained highly-classified papers which had to be transported from Downing Street to the House of Commons. 'The ministerial code is clear that official cars can be used to transport classified documents which must be handled securely. 'Therefore, these journeys had to be made regardless of whether the Chief Whip was in the car himself.' The government boasted it had cut the cost of cars for ministers by 44 per cent in the first year of the coalition. The number of ministers who have access to an official car was cut from 78 to 13, with some Cabinet ministers forced to share cars or take the bus.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Chief Whip driven short distances using £110,000 government car service .\\nUses silver Jaguar to make trips between Parliament and Downing Street .\\nHe defends journeys because cars are used to transport secret papers .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLos Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother and his three children will be immersed in the pop icon's music, dance and imagery as they attend the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's \"Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour\" in Montreal, Canada, Sunday. Katherine Jackson, who sat through four days of disturbing testimony in the trial of the doctor charged in her son's death, agreed with the Michael Jackson estate and Cirque du Soleil just this past week to attend the opening performance this weekend, according to a source close to the Jackson family. The agreement is a sign Katherine Jackson and the men who now control her son's estate as executors have reached an understanding that should ease the tensions that erupted in probate court soon after Michael Jackson's death in 2009, the source said. Jackson's mother waged a legal challenge against lawyer John Branca and music executive John McClain, who were named as executors in her son's will, but dropped it several months later. Relations between the Jackson family and the estate have been tense from that beginning. The trip, which includes Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson, will not end until October 9 when they return to Los Angeles following the Michael Forever Tribute show in Cardiff, Wales, next Saturday, the source said. With several of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters also traveling to the Wales concert, most of the Jackson family's eight seats in Dr. Conrad Murray's trial will likely go empty until next week. Jackson's children never saw their father perform live on stage, but the Cirque du Soleil show promises for two hours to \"capture the essence, soul and inspiration of the King of Pop, celebrating a legacy that continues to transcend generations.\" The road tour will reach at least 47 cities in the United States and Canada over the next year. The circus company, legendary for its creative and acrobatic performances, first talked to Jackson seven years ago about the possibility of a Jackson-themed show, Cirque's president said when the agreement with his estate was announced in April 2010. The estate and Cirque du Soleil are equal partners. The MGM Mirage has signed on to host the Las Vegas, Nevada, residency starting in 2012. The hotel also will open a nightclub based on the Jackson show, the hotel said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Jackson's mother will miss at least the next week of the Conrad Murray trial .\\nKatherine Jackson's agreement to go to Cirque du Soleil shows peace with estate, source says .\\n\\\"Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour\\\" will go to 47 cities in the next year.\\nPrince, Paris, Blanket never saw their father perform live on stage .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- How do you swipe $7 million in toys, electronics and other stuff without anyone noticing? Apparently, in Mom's flowing black dress, according to federal prosecutors who have charged three members of an Illinois family with transporting stolen property across state lines. They'd been at it for a decade, prosecutors said. Prosecutors say Lela Bogdanov stuffed merchandise in the blue lining of her big black dress, then walked out of the stores -- often with family members staging a diversion to draw the attention of employees. The family -- Lela Bogdanov, her husband Branko Bogdanov, both in their 50s, and daughter Julia Bogdanov, 34 -- then sold many of the items to a fence who unloaded them on eBay, prosecutors claim. The alleged fence is cooperating with authorities and was not named by prosecutors. The couple netted more than $4 million from the sale of stolen goods with a retail value of more than $7 million, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago. The Bogdanovs' decade-long scheme began to unravel, prosecutors say, when loss-prevention experts at Barnes and Noble and Toys R Us noticed huge amounts of merchandise had gone missing. They found an eBay account selling the same items in similar quantities as those allegedly stolen from their stores. Secret Service agents arrested the trio Wednesday at their Northbrook, Illinois, home. They'd just returned home from a trip to Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, during which prosecutors say they stole more items. If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and restitution.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Three Illinois family members accused in decade-long shoplifting ring .\\nProsecutors say they stole more than $7 million in goods .\\nHow?

Alan Horowitz was convicted in 1991 on 34 counts of child molestation. Officers from the U.S. Marshals service arrested the 60-year-old at Newark Liberty International Airport after a 15-hour flight from New Delhi, India. The ordained Orthodox rabbi and former child psychologist was arrested on May 22 at a seaside resort in Mahabalipuram, India, according to parole officer Robert Georgia. An agent from the Diplomatic Security Service escorted him aboard the Continental Airlines flight, authorities said. He is being held at a correctional facility in New Jersey and will appear before an extradition judge on July 16th before being taken to New York to face a parole violation charge there. He also faces a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.   Watch Horowitz in custody at Newark airport » . A number of Internet tipsters in India were responsible for alerting the Marshal's service to Horowitz's whereabouts, said U.S. Marshal Gary Mattison, who was assigned to track down Horowitz last year. Horowitz served 13 years of a 10-20 year sentence for child molestation and was released on parole in 2004, authorities said. In June 2006, he fled the country shortly after meeting with his parole officer, setting off the manhunt that involved the Indian police, agents from the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, and U.S. Marshals, U.S. Marshals told CNN. Horowitz's 1991 conviction was on 34 counts of child molestation in Schenectady, New York. A dual citizen of the United States and Israel, Horowitz has also been convicted of \"perverted sexual practices\" in Maryland, where he was found guilty of abusing one of his patients, federal marshals said. During the 1980s, while he was living in Israel, he was the subject of a police investigation into charges he was sexually abusing his second wife's children, according to the U.S. Marshal service. He also faced another sexual misconduct investigation while living in North Carolina, authorities say. E-mail to a friend .

This is something we have been aware of and we are conducting an internal investigation to find out what exactly did or did not happen.\" Donahue, who is part of the sheriff's force at Avalon that polices California's Catalina Island, is on medical leave.

Since the  Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of City in 2008 they have turned themselves into a huge Premier League force, winning the title twice in the last three seasons. And despite being heavily criticised for their transfer policy, spending hundreds of millions on top-class talent, Kompany insists the club's long-term future is bright and at the same time sustainable. He told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a club that is investing in all the right places. Our success comes all the way from the top. Classy: Vincent Kompany has established himself as one of the top defenders in the world at Manchester City . Euphoria: Kompany holds aloft the Premier League title as City clinch their second title in three years . 'From our owner, Sheikh Mansour, to our chairman Khaldoon, and all the way down to the players. 'The manager (Manuel Pellegrini) has played a big role in that, also. He is always calm, he never panics, and that message gets through to the players. 'I know City built up a negative ­reputation in the minds of some people, but if all the investment that has taken place isn't a statement of stability and commitment then I don't know what is. Man mountain: Kompany is a important player for his country Belgium as well as his club . 'Nothing is short-term here. Everything is geared towards being successful now and in the future - and you can only do that if the club is stable.' The 28-year-old is well on his way to becoming the club's all-time most successful captain, so far winning  two Premier League titles, the Capital One Cup and the Community Shield as skipper. Elsewhere, next up for the champions is a trip to Arsenal in the early game on Saturday as they look to close the three-point gap on the leaders Chelsea .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The City captain is confident the club will continue to be successful .\\nThe club have won the title in two of the last three seasons .\\nCity's transfer policy has come under scrutiny after splashing out millions on top-class players since their takeover in 2008 .\\nHowever Kompany insists the club's long-term future is bright .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Former rugby superstar Jonah Lomu has revealed that he is poised to make a shock playing comeback at the age of 34 with French third-division club Marseille Vitrolles. Jonah Lomu pictured in action for New Zealand's All Blacks during the 1999 World Cup in France. The giant New Zealander, who became a global name after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the All Blacks at the 1995 World Cup, retired in 2007 after a succession of injuries hampered his attempt to return following a kidney transplant. He played 63 internationals, the last of them in 2002, but was never able to regain his previous dominance even after regaining full health. \"Marseille Vitrolles is on the point of finalizing the transfer of the greatest legend in world rugby,\" said statement on the club's Web site. Lomu, who is featuring in a new worldwide advertising campaign for sportswear manufacturer adidas called \"Nothing Is Impossible\", was also quoted as confirming his desire to return to the playing field. \"I took a sabbatical year to be at my pregnant partner's side and to fully enjoy this important moment in any man's life,\" he said on the Web site. \"Everyone thought I had ended my playing career, but that was wrong. I still feel the desire to play and it will be me alone who decides when to call it a day. \"My ambition is to help a club like Marseille join the group of top clubs in France.\" Lomu was first diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996. He successfully returned to the game after treatment, but in May 2003 he was put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function, with the treatment's side effects leaving him with severe nerve damage in his feet and legs. Lomu faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed, so underwent the operation. He signed a two-year contract with New Zealand province North Harbour in 2005, and also played for Welsh club Cardiff Blues during the southern hemisphere's off-season. However, he was unable to achieve his goal of being selected in the All Blacks squad for the 2007 World Cup in France, having suffered a shoulder injury. Lomu agreed to play in a charity match in England last year, but withdrew after injuring his ankle in training.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu to join French third-division club .\\nThe 34-year-old will play for Marseille Vitrolles after supposedly retiring in 2007 .\\nNew Zealander became rugby's first global superstar after the 1995 World Cup .\\nHe previously returned to playing after having a kidney transplant .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLos Angeles (CNN) -- A tree dedicated to the memory of Beatle George Harrison, whose solo career included the hit \"What is Life,\" has met a grisly end to its life from the jaws of voracious bark beetles. A pine stump now lies a few feet from a plaque dedicated to Harrison at the foot of a hiking trail in Los Angeles's Griffith Park. City officials say the 12-foot-tall pine had to be cut down June 18, to spare nearby trees from the spread of infestation by bark beetles. \"But we are going to replant a new George Harrison tree in November,\" said L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, a local politician well known for his undying optimism and ceaseless attendance of civic events. \"We're going to wait until after the summer when the weather cools off again.\" The original Japanese black pine tree was planted in 2003 near the Griffith Park Observatory and dedicated in 2004. \"He meant a lot to me, George was my favorite Beatle,\" LaBonge reflected. \"I saw him at (nearby) Dodger Stadium in 1966. George just did so much for so many people. I think he was the first rocker ever to stage a fund-raising event, the Concert for Bangladesh.\" Near the tree stump, a plaque reads \"In memory of a great humanitarian who touched the world as an artist, a musician and gardener.\" Below that it reads, \"For the forest to be green, each tree must be green,\" a quote attributed to Harrison. Harrison, often called the quiet Beatle, died of lung cancer in 2001 in Beverly Hills. In a photo that LaBonge says he took five or six years ago to mark an anniversary of Harrison's passing, the mature tree is ringed by family friends. The picture includes Harrison's widow Olivia, Eric Idle of Monty Python fame and Jeff Lynne, the Electric Light Orchestra frontman who played with Harrison in The Travelling Wilburys. Beatles songs written by Harrison include \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something.\" The virtuoso guitar player's signature riffs and solos helped propel the Beatles to greatness and his experimentation with Eastern Indian music could be heard with his sitar work on \"Norwegian Wood.\" Now, in a city park where there was once a specific wood -- a George Harrison tree -- there's a stump. But LaBonge, borrowing from a Harrison album title, vows \"All Things Must Pass\" including the lack of a George Harrison tree. \"When you plant a tree to memorialize someone, it's a special thing.\" LaBonge said. \"And I promise you in November this will be special again when we dedicate the new tree.\" Ron Howard to direct Beatles concert documentary . 5 things to know about Beatlemania .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"A tree dedicated to the memory of Beatle George Harrison stood for more than a decade .\\nThe Japanese black pine tree was in Griffith Park in Los Angeles .\\nThe tree had to be cut down because of an infestation of bark beetles .\\nA city councilman vows that, beetles notwithstanding, another tree will stand for a Beatle soon .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBritish metal band, The Defiled, has just made history. They are the first-ever band to play a live gig atop a gigantic iceberg - located in the middle of the Greenland Sea. The Defiled performed on top of a floating platform for the Jägermeister Ice Cold Gig – which sees artists put to the test as they perform in unconventional, ice-cold conditions. Scroll down for video . British metal band, The Defiled, played the world's first-ever gig on a floating iceberg . And between the freezing temperatures and fast flowing ice, the rock stars did just that. The small crowd, mostly from the nearby town of Kulusuk, ventured to the ice field to watch this once-in-a-lifetime gig from fishing boats. To reach their iceberg stage, the band first flew to Iceland, before transferring to Kulusuk, Greenland, and then heading by boat to the small island of Tasiilaq, which has a population of just over 2000. It actually took several days of searching to find the 'perfect' berg - one that was large and thick enough to hold the band and all of their equipment. It took days of searching to find the perfect iceberg - it needed to be large and thick enough to hold the band . Locals, who have lived and worked on the icebergs for years, helped the band to shuttle their instruments and sound equipment to the gig stage, and to thank them for their help, the group donated their equipment to the local community hall after the gig. Band member Stitch D said: 'This has to be one of the most insane gigs we've ever played! You see these things on TV documentaries but it's not until you get to see them in real life that you realise just how big and amazing icebergs are. 'Although it was cold, I don't think any of us noticed once we got started. The stage location literally takes your breath away.' To capture the footage, state-of-the-art flying drone cameras were used and controlled by nearby boats . Known for their dark and imposing on-stage outfits - which provided an incredible contrast to the all-white surroundings - The Defiled played a 30 minute set in total, featuring tracks from their latest album Daggers. To capture the footage, Jägermeister and the band utilised state-of-the-art 'octocopter flying drone cameras,' controlled remotely by the boats nearby, which hovered above the iceberg. Tom Carson, Jägermeister music manager, added: 'As far as stage backdrops go, I don’t think you’ll find anything more impressive than this.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The Defiled played the world's first gig on top of a floating iceberg .\\nThe group went to Greenland as part of Jägermeister's Ice Cold Gig series .\\nAfter the gig, they donated their instruments to the local community hall .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy . Pete D'amato for MailOnline . Three Florida teenagers took advantage of their Labor Day off. Police in Polk County arrested three high schoolers, saying the teens commandeered a school bus for an extracurricular trip through central Florida, picking up their friends along the way. According to officials, the teens came across an unlocked bus with the keys left inside at a lot next to Lake Wales High School. The group took the bus off the lot and drove through several towns, stopping to pick up three friends along the way. Scroll down for video . Caught: The teenagers covered up three video cameras on the bus but a fourth caught them walking through the bus . According to ABC Action News, the bus was gone from 10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. Monday morning. The group dropped the bus off unscathed at the school, having clocked 180 during their joyride. The school only realized something was amiss when a routine inspection of the bus on Tuesday showed fuel missing and extra mileage on the odometer. The high schoolers had covered three of the bus's security cameras, but apparently failed to locate the fourth, which caught two of the teens on tape. The Tampa Bay Tribune reports the teenagers were identified by a staff member at Lake Wales High School, where one of the teenagers is a student. The other students attend nearby schools. Police arrested the three minors and charged them with grand theft auto and trespassing on school property. The three friends that joined them for the ride were also charged with trespassing on school property.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"The three high schoolers found the bus unlocked with the keys inside in a lot at Lake Wales High School, say police .\\nThe three covered video cameras in the bus, but one uncovered camera caught footage used to identify them .\\nThe teenagers were arrested and charged with grand theft auto and trespassing on school property .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nIf you're serving burgers and Bud Light at your backyard wedding, don't worry. You and your spouse may have the last laugh. A new study found that couples who spend less on their wedding tend to have longer-lasting marriages than those who splurge. The study, by two economics professors at Emory University, found a similar correlation between less-expensive engagement rings and lower divorce rates. The study's authors didn't examine why, although they floated a few theories. \"It could be that the type of couples who have a ... (cheap wedding) are the type that are a perfect match for each other,\" said Professor Hugo M. Mialon, who co-authored the study with Andrew M. Francis. \"Or it could be that having an inexpensive wedding relieves young couples of financial burdens that may strain their marriage,\" he said. The research was based on a detailed survey completed by 3,151 adults in the United States who are, or have been, married. The authors believe theirs is the first academic study to examine the correlation between wedding expenses and the length of marriages. Specifically, the study found that women whose wedding cost more than $20,000 divorced at a rate roughly 1.6 times higher than women whose wedding cost between $5,000 and $10,000. And couples who spent $1,000 or less on their big day had a lower than average rate of divorce. The study won't be cheered by the booming wedding industry, which encourages couples to spend freely on everything from invitations and flowers to videographers and Champagne. Couples in the United States spent an average of $29,858 for their big day in 2013 -- a record high -- according to a survey of 13,000 brides and grooms by wedding website TheKnot.com. \"The wedding industry has long associated lavish weddings with longer-lasting marriages. Industry advertising has fueled norms that create the impression that spending large amounts on the wedding is a signal of commitment or is necessary for a marriage to be successful,\" Francis told CNN in an e-mail. \"Overall, our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry's general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes,\" he said. Planning a wedding? In addition to slashing costs, you might want to invite those extra co-workers and far-flung cousins, too. The Emory study also found that the greater the number of people who attend a wedding, the lower the rate of divorce. \"This could be evidence of a community effect, i.e., having more support from friends and family may help the couple to get through the challenges of marriage,\" Francis said. \"Or this could be that the type of couples who have a lot of friends and family are also the type that tend not to divorce as much.\"\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Study: Couples who spend less on their wedding have longer-lasting marriages .\\nA similar correlation was found between cheaper engagement rings and lower divorce rates .\\nThe research was based on a survey completed by 3,151 ever-married adults in the U.S.\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Ain Shams University Biologist Hebat Abdel Hadi is taking \"waste not, want not\" to a whole other level. Alphonso Van Marsh discovered first hand how damaging the Nile crayfish can be. She says crayfish carcasses the part of the crustacean that humans often throw away are for the birds. As higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson's Food to report losses this year, Abdel Hadi says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens. Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed. Her studies included comparing chickens fed with fish meal, with those raised on meal made with crayfish waste. \"The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat. The color of the meat is better, the taste is better, it looks better,\" she says. The crayfish carcass is largely shell and skeleton. Feed nutritionists say crayfish-sourced feed would therefore contain high percentages of calcium and minerals. As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs. But poultry nutrition experts warn that chicken farming is a complex science that involves multiple nutrition and energy needs. \"The challenge has to do more with genetics, and the right balance for this fast growing bird,\" says Martin Humphries, Feed Sales Director for an English specialist poultry feed supplier. \"Crayfish heads will have some meat in there for protein. Crayfish skeletons will have calcium and I'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [feeding crayfish to chickens] is a leap too far for now,\" Humphries says. Egypt is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the Nile River. Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt. The crayfish that have a penchant for clawing into fishermen's nets and eating their catch are causing problems for fishermen. But are there enough crayfish to sustain a chicken feed industry? Andrew Kendall, a spokesman with the UK's largest feed manufacturer BOCM Pauls is unsure. \"Theoretically, it is possible to use crayfish remains, but they would be in such short supply it would not be a feasible solution. For manufacturers who make any kind any business on a large scale, there's not enough [crayfish] supply to be a viable business. However, it could be better for a niche market,\" he says.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh spent time with Nile fishermen in Egypt .\\nEgypt is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the Nile River.\\nCrayfish have been a problem for fishermen, but now used in chicken feed .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declared Friday that it will decide whether same-sex couples nationwide have a right to marry under the Constitution, and get the question settled by June. The justices said they will review an appellate ruling that upheld bans on same-sex unions in four states. The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected before July. Gay rights advocates like Vin Testa (pictured) will anxiously await a resolution to the gay marriage debate just months from now . Hilary Matheson (left) and Kay Flatten (right) kissed after they were pronounced 'married' by Rev. Allison Farnum at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Fort Myers, Fla., on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2015; they had been together for 28 year before they weer allowed to legally tie the knot . Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee are among the 14 states where gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to marry. The number of states that permit same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in three months as a result of federal and state court rulings. The justices' decision to turn away same-sex marriage appeals in October and allowed some of those rulings to take effect. Florida last week became the 36th state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. If the high court rules that the bans in the current case violate the U.S. Constitution, gay-marriage floodgates in the remaining 14 states would open. The justices made their decision during a closed-door conference, opting to dispose of the issue in April, the last month for oral arguments before their next term begins in October. Written arguments will have to be filed on a compressed schedule, though both sides are well versed in the issues after numerous rounds in lower courts. On Friday the Supreme Court met in closed conference to decide whether it would take up cases including several concerning same sex-marriage and marriage recognition by states . In October, the justices offered no explanation when they passed up appeals from both sides calling on the court to take up gay marriage. The appeals before the court come from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. The federal appeals court that oversees them upheld same-sex marriage bans there in November, reversing rulings of federal judges in all four states.

A small aircraft is observed by the U.S. Navy flying over the Sirius Star during a seeming ransom payment Friday. The pirates had been expected to release the Sirius Star, which they've held since November 15, after a ransom payment was parachuted onto the ship. The journalist told CNN that the pirate who spoke said four pirates drowned after a skiff carrying leaving the Sirius Star capsized due to rough seas. Sea charts showed that waves in the area were reaching 5 to 7 feet at the time. There were five pirates in the skiff and one survived, the journalist said. The bodies of the other four were recovered, he said, adding that this will delay the exit of the pirates still remaining on board the ship and thus affect the ship's release after payment of the ransom. The tanker was carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million when pirates hijacked it off the coast of Somalia. Pirates seized the Sirius Star more than 450 nautical miles off the African coast in one of their most audacious hijackings to date. The pirates told another journalist that they received $3 million in ransom money, but lost part of it when the skiff capsized. The remaining ransom money is still aboard the ship with the rest of the pirates. The U.S. Navy took photographs and observed as an apparent ransom payment was parachuted aboard the tanker. The pirates aboard the supertanker have equipment to check for counterfeit bills, authorities said. \"While the potential release of the Sirius Star is undoubtedly excellent news, we must not forget that nearly 300 other merchant mariners (on other ships) are still being held captive,\" said Commodore Tim Lowe, deputy Combined Maritime Forces commander. Hijackings off East Africa are a cause of growing international concern, spurring a number of international navies to patrol the pirate-wracked Gulf of Aden.

The area involved, off the coast of Somalia and Kenya as well as the Gulf of Aden, equals more than 1.1 million square miles.

Some of the 30 people who were aboard the icebreaker Arctic Sunrise are likely to face additional charges, the Russian Investigative Committee said. Authorities say they think the narcotics include opium. The 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists who were arrested on the ship as they protested Arctic drilling already face piracy charges. All 30 pleaded not guilty in court last week. The Investigative Committee said Russian experts were looking into the \"origin and purpose\" of the drugs seized, which it described as \"presumably opium straw and morphine.\" Greenpeace said the claim that Russian authorities had found drugs on the vessel \"is a smear, it's a fabrication, pure and simple.\" \"We assume this announcement is designed to deflect attention from the growing global outrage over the continued imprisonment of the detainees,\" it said in a written statement. The environmental campaign group has repeatedly condemned the detention of its activists, saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest against the \"slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic.\" Russian authorities made the arrests after two of the activists left the Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea. The government in the Netherlands -- where the Arctic Sunrise is registered -- wrote to the Dutch parliament Friday to say it has launched legal action aimed at freeing the 30 under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. Two of those detained are Dutch citizens. Greenpeace holds vigil, Dutch launch legal action . The defendants also include Americans Peter Wilcox, who is the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, and Dmitry Litvinov, who Greenpeace says also holds Swedish citizenship. The other detainees are from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Britain, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, the United States and Sweden, the group said. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Greenpeace ship captain defies orders, Russians resort to towing . Lawyers acting on Greenpeace's behalf have filed appeals in court seeking the defendants' release, Greenpeace said. Russian authorities accuse the defendants of trying to commandeer the platform. The authorities and Gazprom also say that the activists endangered the lives of the company's employees and that their action could have led to an environmental disaster.

After some efforts from his friends, Lawrence Oakford, 23, and Chris Burge, 18, failed to budge him, they dialled 101 for help. Firefighters arrived and tried but failed to pull Shaun out, so they had to take the swing apart.  Shaun was treated for thigh injuries by paramedics before being allowed home.

Shaun said: 'They found the whole thing hilarious and put it on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other places. 'They were just taking the mick constantly.' He explained his decision to sit in the swing, saying: 'We were walking up towards the park on Sunday when I decided to sit down somewhere dry to roll a fag and have a smoke.

Daily Mail Reporter . Charged: Alicia D Brown was arrested for child abuse after her little girl was found alone in a car . A Maryland mother who left her four-year-old child in a casino parking lot for eight hours has been charged with child abuse. Alicia D Brown was spotted on security camera footage arriving in the parking garage at 10am on December 1. Security guards found the little girl after hearing her crying at about 6.30pm. She was alone in the car, which had blankets taped up around the windows. As police prepared to remove the child, who was cold and hungry, the mother returned and was arrested. She had been seen entering the casino area on cameras shortly after parking her car on the fourth level of the garage. Temperatures were close to freezing on Tuesday but apart from being cold, the child appeared to be healthy and there were no signs of physical abuse. The girl was taken to a medical center for a check up after being found in a state of distress. Brown was not working at the casino, but it was unclear if she had returned to check on the child during the day, according to the Baltimore Sun. The 24-year-old, from Baltimore, has been charged with child abuse, confining an unattended child and neglect of a minor. She was being held on a $150,000 bond and her daughter has been handed over to a relative. Police spokesman Lieutenant TJ Smith told WBalTV: 'I don't care if they had that whole car set up like a day care center. That child should not be left alone in a car by herself.' Alone: The four-year-old girl was found in a parking garage of Maryland Live! casino on December 31 . He added: '[This is] parental selfishness, absolute stupidity, just a reckless, reckless abandonment.' Casino president Rob Norton told News4: 'Incidents of parental neglect and lack . of personal responsibility are disturbing.' He added: 'We are thankful that our . security team was able to intervene and get the appropriate authorities . involved and that we found the child unharmed.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Alicia Brown was seen arriving in parking garage at 10am .\\nSecurity guards found little girl crying inside car at 6.30pm .\\nBrown was arrested for child abuse .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

A 12-year-old girl has killed herself after relentless online bullying from her classmates, her family has claimed. Gabrielle Molina's 15-year-old sister found the young girl hanging in a bedroom at her family's home in Queens Village, New York on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The girl, who attended a local middle school, left a heartbreaking note explaining that she had taken her life after suffering taunts online from her classmates, the New York Post explained. Tragedy: Gabrielle Molina, 12, was found hanged in a bedroom at her family's home in Queens, pictured . In the letter, she also apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life. Her mother told police that Gabrielle was depressed over the taunts and revealed that her other daughter, Georgia, had forced her way into the bedroom when Gabrielle did not answer. Gabrielle's aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she didn't understand the young girl's death. 'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted . to dance and sing. She’s so young.' Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years. 'Cruel': Fellow students at her school, pictured, drove her to suicide, she reportedly explained in a note . 'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.' The National Crime Prevention Council notes that 43 per cent of teens are subject to cyberbullying, and there have been recent, high profile cases. In one heartbreaking story, 15-year-old Felecia Garcia killed herself last October after fellow students allegedly posted a video of her having sex with members of the football team. She was branded a 'slut' and humiliated by her classmates online, eventually taking her life by jumping in front of a train.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Gabrielle Molina 'left a note explaining she had been taunted'\\nHer sister, 15, forced open a bedroom door and found her body .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA suspected Islamic militant returning to Europe from the war in Syria was arrested on Sunday at Malaga airport in southern Spain as a potential \"threat to national security,\" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The suspect, Abdeluahid Sadik Mohamed, belongs to an al Qaeda-linked group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the statement said. A spokesman for the Ministry confirmed Sadik Mohamed is a Spanish national born in Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on Morocco's north coast. He had spent months alongside Islamic militants fighting in Syria and in Iraq since last May, arriving to the region from Casablanca, Morocco. He was arrested at Malaga airport on a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, the statement said. Spanish terrorism experts have repeatedly said that authorities are closely tracking the movements of Islamic militants who have fought in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan when they come to Europe for the threat they pose as potential \"lone wolves\" or in group terrorist actions. Sadik Mohamed was allegedly involved in terrorist training camps in Syria and Iraq, the statement said. The Interior Ministry did not immediately reveal his age. He was a suspect in a partially dismantled Spanish and Moroccan network of Islamic militants that recruited, indoctrinated, trained and financed militants to be sent to the battlefronts in Syria. The network was based in Ceuta and and in the nearby Moroccan city of Fnideq. Ten militants allegedly linked to this network have been jailed on pretrial charges of terrorism, including the alleged leader who was arrested September 17 after escaping detention in June. Eight other suspected colleagues were rounded up at that time. In a court order issued in June, Judge Ismael Moreno of Spain's National Court wrote that the suspected cell in Ceuta was \"a structure based in Spain, with connections in Morocco, Belgium, Turkey and Syria, dedicated to radicalizing, recruiting and sending mujahedeen (fighters) to Syria with the aim of conducting jihad and achieving martyrdom.\" The group has connections to the Jabhat al-Nusra front, described as an active al Qaeda group in and around Syria, and to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , but \"there are increasing references to carrying out jihad at home,\" the judge warned at the time, referring to potential attacks in Spain. The group had sent at least 12 Spanish or Moroccan males, from both Ceuta and Morocco, to fight in Syria, the judge wrote. At least five died in suicide attacks in Syria that caused numerous casualties. One of the males was a minor; it was not immediately clear if he was among those who had died. Sadik Mohamed will be arraigned at the National Court in Madrid, the Interior Ministry statement said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Suspect is a Spanish national .\\nThe suspect is tied to an al Qaeda-linked group .\\nThe arrest took place at Malaga airport .\\nSadik Mohamed will be arraigned at the National Court in Madrid, .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nMiranda Kerr ensured all eyes were on her earlier today when she turned up to the Louis Vuitton SS15 show as part of Paris Fashion Week.

President Bill Clinton remembered Minnesota's longest-serving Congressman as a tireless public servant. \"Jim was a devoted friend and supporter of the Haitian people. I relied on him for advice on Haiti first as President and again after the terrible Haitian earthquake in 2010,\" Clinton said in a statement. Oberstar was the state's longest-serving member of Congress. He became chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in 2006. In a close race, he lost to Republican challenger Chip Cravaack in the Republican House takeover in 2010. \"Jim Oberstar knew everything there was to know about our nation's infrastructure, and fought tirelessly to rebuild and renew it,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. \"... His passing is heartbreaking news for his friends and former colleagues from both sides of the aisle. It was an honor and a privilege to work alongside him, and we only hope it is a comfort to his wife Jean, his children and his grandchildren that so many share in their loss at this sad time.\" Minnesota officials are mourning Oberstar's loss. DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin said that the state lost a true Minnesota legend. Gov. Mark Dayton called him a \"true champion\" for Minnesota. Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted he was a \"man of true purpose and grit.\" Oberstar is survived by his wife, four children and eight grandchildren.

The man was boarding a rush hour train at Stirling station, 9km northwest of Perth, Western Australia, at 8.50am when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap. Quick-thinking passengers and staff saved the man's leg, as it was being squeezed by the 90-tonne of train, by collectively rocking the carriage. Scroll down for video . He was boarding a Perth-bound train at Stirling Station when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap . Quick-thinking passengers and staff pushed the 90-tonne train to help free his leg . 'He stood in the doorway and as he was sort of taking up his position there, one leg slipped outside the door, slipped outside the gap, and he was stuck,' Transperth spokesman David Hynes told the  ABC. 'We alerted the driver, made sure the train didn't move. 'Then our staff who were there at the time got the passengers, and there were lots of them, off the train, and organised them to sort of rock, tilt the train backwards away from the platform so they were able to get him out and rescue him.' The man was boarding the rush hour train when slipped into the crack to the horror of passengers . A number of passengers got off the train to help rail staff rock the train to help set the man free . An ambulance was called to the station but the man did not sustain any serious injuries. Mr Hynes said it was not a problem caused by overcrowding and praised the actions of staff and passengers who helped free the man. 'Everyone sort of pitched in. It was people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury,' he said. The man (circled) was helped away by a staff member so he could be treated by paramedics, as passengers re-boarded the train . Nicolas Taylor told Perth Now that he and fellow passengers got off the train and worked together to free the man by pushing against the carriage away from the platform. 'He seemed to be a bit sheepish, because right where he fell was the ‘mind the gap’ writing,' he said. Mr Taylor said Transperth staff coordinated the incident well, taking about 10 minutes to free him. 'They did a really good job, they took control and handled it well. When I first saw it I thought we’d be there for hours.' he said.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"People power saved a commuter whose leg became wedged between the gap in Perth, Western Australia during rush hour .\\nTransperth praised the actions of all who helped lift the train off the man .\\nThe incident was not a problem caused by overcrowding .\\nAmbulance were called but the man escaped without injury .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nLos Angeles (CNN) -- Comedic actor Chris Kattan was charged with driving under the influence after his car slammed into a highway construction truck on a Los Angeles freeway early Monday, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.

The Premier League champions were humbled 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium by the Championship outfit, who progressed thanks to goals from Patrick Bamford and Garcia Kike. City spent the five days prior to Saturday's fourth-round tie at a warm-weather training camp in the United Arab Emirates. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini (right)  reacts next to Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka . The team only returned to Manchester on Friday evening and questions were quickly asked about the wisdom of the venture. Manager Pellegrini denied post-match that City's travel arrangements were a factor in the reverse, an opinion shared by Royle, who managed the club between 1998 and 2001. \"I honestly don't think it makes a lot of difference,\" Royle told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Karanka celebrates with Grant Leadbitter after the FA Cup Fourth Round match victory over City . \"Players will have trained out there and the way players travel, they are hardly put away in steerage at the back, they go first class anywhere. \"I don't think there is any great merit in that, there will be a number of teams that have gone away and won games when they returned. \"It's quite a regular thing, so not too much at all in that.\" City return to league action next weekend when they face leaders Chelsea, who were also knocked out of the cup after losing to League one side Bradford at Stamford Bridge, and Royle believes it will be a vital match in their quest to retain the title. Patrick Bamford  celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game against Manchester City . Garcia Kike of Middlesbrough celebrates with team-mates after scoring his team's second goal . \"I thought that the signing of (Wilfried) Bony would give them a stimulus but he's away at the moment and can't make an impact at all,\" Royle added. \"We don't know how Chelsea will respond.

The justices on Tuesday issued an order granting a stay of execution for Cleve Foster, about 2 1/2 hours before his scheduled lethal injection. The Gulf War veteran was convicted along with another man of the 2002 murder of Nyanuer \"Mary\" Pal, a Sudanese immigrant he met at a Fort Worth bar. The court indicated it would need more time to rule on the inmate's claims of prior ineffective assistance of counsel, and related claims of innocence of the murder. This is the third time Foster, 47, has been granted a high court reprieve. His previous scheduled execution was stopped in January and April, once after he had already been given his last meal. His April procedure was to be the state's first execution using a new sedative, the first in the lethal drug cocktail. A nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental forced corrections officials to announce they would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate that has alternately been used to put animals to sleep. Foster's lawyers had challenged that change, saying Texas foisted the new protocols so late, with little time for legal or medical review. The state has since executed several inmates with the new drug mixture, without noted complications. Foster has blamed his co-conspirator for the murder. His lawyers in their Supreme Court appeal presented letters from three fellow inmates who said co-defendant Sheldon Ward told them he acted alone in Pal's murder. The state countered Ward's statements to a psychologist implicating Foster as the mastermind behind the killing. They also said DNA from both men were found in the victim. Texas has a planned lethal injection Wednesday. Lawrence Brewer, 44, was one of two white men convicted in the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr., an African-American. That widely reported crime led to national movement to step up prosecutions and penalties for hate crimes. Brewer has no pending appeals. It would be the 11th execution this year in Texas, the most active death-penalty state. The current case is Foster v. Texas (11-6427).\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Court grants Cleve Foster his third stay of execution .\\nThe order came just 2 1/2 hours before the scheduled lethal injection .\\nHe was scheduled to die for the 2002 murder of a Sudanese woman .\\nCourt said it needed more time to rule on his claims of ineffective counsel .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nTEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Officials say two men in Iran have been stoned to death for adultery and murder, while another escaped death by digging his way out of the hole where he was buried to face a similar fate, according to media reports. The sentences follow sharp criticism by human rights groups of Iran's use of such punishments. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi on Tuesday told reporters about the stonings, which took place in the northeastern city of Mashhad about 20 days ago, the reports said. According to the Mashhad prosecutor, the men committed various crimes, including adultery and murder, Jamshidi said. In the practice, the men are buried up to their chests and people pelt them with stones until they die. A third was supposed to have been stoned to death. However, he freed himself by climbing out of the stone hole. He still awaits punishment. \"Stoning is a horrific practice, designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution, and it has no place in the modern world,\" Amnesty International said last year. Jamshidi said Iran's judiciary chief, Ayatollah Heshemi Shahroudi, had made recommendations that would ban the practice and said that a measure has been introduced in Parliament to stop the punishment. But \"until this measure is approved and becomes law, the judges have the independence not to pay heed to the recommendations of the Judiciary chief,\" Jamshidi said. Amnesty said in a report last year that Iran's penal code allows execution by stoning as the penalty for adultery. The group said the law calls for stones \"large enough to cause pain, but not so large as to kill the victim immediately.\" In August, Amnesty International issued a statement welcoming an announcement that stoning had been suspended and several women had their sentences commuted. In that announcement, the group said at least one stoning execution was carried out in 2007 in Qazvin province and a woman and a man were known to have been stoned to death in Mashhad in May 2006. \"The majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women. Women are not treated equally with men under the law and by courts, and they are also particularly vulnerable to unfair trials because their higher illiteracy rate makes them more likely to sign confessions to crimes they did not commit,\" Amnesty said.

Greg Sandoval and his partner were renovating their house in Fontana, California, when they pulled away a wall panel to find a plastic bag hidden there more than 36 years ago. The package contained a note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card - and was signed by seventh-grader Robert Wright. Times a-changing: Robert Wright, shown left as a schoolboy, hid a time capsule in the wall of his home in Fontana, California, when he was 12. Now he is aged 49 (right), the capsule has been rediscovered . 'Hello whoever finds this': The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad's DIY was giving him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date . The note read: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. 'Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon. I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. 'I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes. Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.' Discovery: Greg Sandoval and his partner, pictured, found the capsule inside the wall of the same home while the were renovating . McDonadl's baseball quiz: The plastic bag containing a note, coins - and this scratchcard from a McDonald's restaurant . Laid out: Above the items which were removed from the plastic bag can be seen . At first, Sandoval had no idea who Wright really was - and his own searches came to nothing. But after telling his story to local news station ABC7, news the capsule had been found made it across the country to the boy - now grown into a 49-year-old man. Wright, who lives in Austin, Texas, said he was inundated with messages after the local news story - and realized the boy in question must have been his schoolboy self. Home: Pictured above is the house in Fontana, California, which concealed the capsule for 36 years . He told ABC News: 'I watched the video link and was like, ‘Oh my gosh. This is me. I am that Robert Wright.' Recalling the moment he stashed away the package, he said: 'I wrote the note and it wasn’t enough and I needed proof of the date so I tore off a newspaper. 'I don’t have any recollection of the McDonald’s ticket - my guess is I just ran off into my room and grabbed whatever I could find with the date on it and just stuck it in the baggy and threw it in the wall.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Greg Sandoval found capsule from 36 years ago in his home, signed by child .\\nRobert Wright, a seventh-grader, had filled a pouch with note and coins .\\nAlso included a promotional scratchcard from McDonald's .\\nWright, now 49 and living in Texas, heard about the find and came forward .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Police released few details about how they found the items that were stolen in late 2010 near a London train station. They were found at a house in central England. The violin was recovered intact with some very minor damage, they said. \"We're delighted to have recovered the violin after a long and very complex investigation,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor, who led the hunt. He said members of other police forces, an insurance company, and antique dealers helped with the investigation. Two teenagers were arrested and sentenced in 2011 in connection with the theft of the 1696 Stradivarius. The violin's owner, acclaimed violinist Min Jin Kym, noticed her case containing the violin and bows was missing and called police. She said she thought about the theft every day, even in her dreams, and was elated to learn it was found. Stradivarius violins were made by the world's most celebrated violin maker, Antonio Stradivari, in the 1600s. It is thought that from 1666, the Cremona, Italy-born Stradivari made 1,116 instruments, of which more than 600 are still in existence, including violas, cellos, mandolins and guitars. During the 18th century, his unrivaled reputation extended throughout Europe where his instruments were coveted by royalty, aristocracy, church dignitaries and top musicians because of the extraordinary sound they were capable of producing. Stradivari made his last violin in 1737 when he was 92. Experts: Bob Dylan's long-lost guitar finally found .

Herring said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing by any of the parties in the lawsuit. Daly had left a Charlottesville, Virginia, supermarket in April 2013 when her car was surrounded by state ABC agents, one of whom drew a firearm and another who had jumped onto the hood of her car. They had mistaken her carton of La Croix sparkling water for beer that her friend had purchased. The young women claimed to be at the grocery story shopping for a charity fundraiser the next day. 'My roommates and I were terrified,' Daly told The Hook. 'We called 911 as we had been taught to do if you were ever unsure of the validity of people saying they are law enforcement.' Daly said she became frantic when unmarked agents surrounded her vehicle, banging on the windows and demanding that she roll them down. One of her two friends in the car had allegedly said that the badges were fake and told her to 'go, go, go' according to the lawsuit cited in the AP report. Unsure whether they were in fact agents, she and her friend fled the scene in the car, grazing two of the agents in the process. The 911 operator was unable to confirm whether the agents were real but while they were near an intersection the operator told them that they were in fact agents, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The women had intended on driving to a local police station while the agents had chased them on foot, according to The Hook. Daly said the agents' credentials were not clearly visible and they did not did identify themselves in an attempt to stop her from leaving the scene. A young woman who was friends with Elizabeth Day had purchased the case of La Croix water that had been mistaken by authorities for beer (stock image) She was subsequently arrested at a red light at the nearby intersection. She faced two counts of assault and one count of eluding — both are Class 6 felonies and she would've faced a maximum of five years in prison and no more than a $2,500 fine but the . charges were later dropped and her record was expunged. Daly filed the suit in Richmond Circuit Court and is alleging malicious prosecution, failure to train ABC agents appropriately as well as six counts of assault and battery.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Elizabeth Daly, now 21, and her friend had their car swarmed by state agents after their case of water was mistaken for beer .\\nDaly had initially sought $40million in damages for a tremor in her right hand, intense anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems .\\nThe young women had been shopping at a local Virginia grocery store one night in April 2013 for a charity fundraiser the next day .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA woman sentenced to two days in jail was locked up for 154 days after a judge forgot to sign the order for her release. Destiny Hoffman, 34, was given two days on August 22 by Clark County Circuit Court Judge Jerry Jacobi in Indiana for diluting her drug screen results, violating her court-appointed treatment program. The judge ordered Ms Hoffman, from Jeffersonville, held without bond 'until further order of the court'. However it then slipped the judge's mind to issue that order for five months. Destiny Hoffman, 34, was given two days on August 22 for an unknown charge in Clark County, Indiana . Judge Jacobi was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline due to the ongoing investigation and an official at Clark County Circuit Court refused to make any further remarks on the matter. According to newsandtribune.com, Judge Jacobi ordered Hoffman sent to jail without a hearing or legal counsel. It is unclear why Ms Hoffman did not let prison officials know that she was being held for an undue length of time. Clark County Deputy Prosecutor Michaelia Gilbert began investigating Hoffman's incarceration last Wednesday while reviewing old case files. She entered a motion seeking an immediate status hearing, writing that Hoffman's civil liberties were violated by the term of her incarceration. Indiana Special Judge Steven Fleece described the incident as a 'big screw up'. Hoffman's attorney, Nathan Masingo, said he was not even aware he client had been jailed and may file a lawsuit against county officials alleging she was unlawfully incarcerated. Two drug court program employees were placed on unpaid leave on January 7 after the mix-up came to light. Ms Hoffman spent five months in jail  for violating her drug treatment program after a judge forgot to sign her release order .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Destiny Hoffman, 34, was given 48-hours for violating her drug treatment program in Indiana .\\nJudge Jacobi forgot to sign release form in August leaving the woman incarcerated until December .\\nThe judge reportedly ordered her to jail without a hearing or legal counsel .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

These days, however, it appears the Osmonds has become two acts rather than one. While Donny and his sister Marie enjoy a run of sell-out shows in Las Vegas, the rest of their siblings were performing in this country – at Butlins in Bognor Regis. The Osmonds, who had a string of number one hits in the early 70s, performed at a nostalgia weekend at Butlins in Bognor . Merrill, 60, Jimmy, 50, and Jay, 58, played two lunchtime shows at the holiday camp. Missing, along with Donny and Marie, were the brothers’ bell-bottoms and, not surprisingly, much of their youthful glamour. They sang to a room full of merry middle-aged women fans who sang along to the hit Crazy Horses and screamed as the trio attempted some of their old dance routines. Many fans had travelled from all over Britain to West Sussex to see the brothers. Watching them for the seventh time, Belinda McLacklan, 52, from Kent, said: ‘We used to bunk off school to try to catch a glimpse of them.’ Dressed in Osmonds memorabilia, Sarah Best, 61, said she felt embarrassed for the group. She added: ‘I remember them wearing bell bottoms but now they look like a bunch of politicians with instruments.’ Take it from the top: Wayne Osmond, Jay Osmond, Merrill Osmond, Alan Osmond, Donny Osmond and Jimmy Osmond . The three-night Seventies event at Butlins cost £80 per night and featured passes to themed events, including the Osmonds’ American Jukebox. As the show ended Jimmy told the fans: ‘We have been all over the world but Butlins you have been one of the best.’ In Vegas, fans have been paying up to £100 for Donny, 55,  and 53-year-old Marie’s shows at the Flamingo Club. The Osmonds, a Mormon family from Utah, began as a barbershop quartet in the late 1950s with Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. They were joined by Donny and Jimmy and in the 1970s. Marie began her solo career in 1973.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Jay, Jimmy and Merrill performed at Butlin's in Bognor .\\nFamily had string of hits together in early 1970's .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

Daily Mail Reporter . Researchers say it is possible to repair a chronically diseased liver by forcing mature liver cells to 'go back in time' to a stem cell-like state. Switching off a liver-growth pathway in mature cells generates high levels of dedifferentiation, which means the cells can revert back to an unspecialized state and regenerate a diseased liver. The breakthrough, published in the journal Cell, could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders. Cell transition: Scientists say when the Hippo pathway is inactivated, mature liver cells revert back to a stem cell-like state. This picture shows a group of cells transitioning from a mature cell type (green) to a stem cell type (red). White cells are the cells where Hippo is being inactivated . Research lead: Fernando Camargo (pictured) is an associate professor in the Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology . Harvard Stem Cell Institute scientists at Boston Children's Hospital made the discovery while investigating whether a biochemical cascade called Hippo, which . controls how big the liver grows, also affects cell fate. Switching off the . Hippo-signaling pathway in mature liver cells means they become . stem-cell like again, allowing them to give rise to functional . progenitor cells that can regenerate a diseased liver. 'I think this study highlights the . tremendous plasticity of mature liver cells,' research lead Fernando Camargo said, according to Science Daily. 'It's not that you have a very small population of . cells that can be recruited to an injury; almost 80 percent of . hepatocytes [liver cells] can undergo this cell fate change.' Camargo's team studied mice born with a genetic liver disease. They cultured healthy liver progenitor cells and transplanted them into the diseased mice. Over about four months, the transplanted liver cells engrafted and the animals' condition improved. 'People have been trying to use liver cell transplants for metabolic diseases since the early 90s, but because of the source of cells - discarded livers-- they were unsuccessful,' Camargo said. 'With this unlimited source of cells from a patient, we think that perhaps it's time to think again about doing hepatocyte or progenitor cell transplants in the context of liver genetic disorders.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Harvard Stem Cell Institute researchers were studying whether the Hippo-signaling pathway, which controls how big the liver grows, also affects cell fate .\\nThey found that switching off the pathway in mature liver cells makes them stem cells again .\\nA stem cell is an unspecialized cell that gives rise to specialized cells .\\nThese stem cells can quickly dedifferentiate to regenerate a diseased liver .\\nThe finding could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAhead of these European Championships qualifiers, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads and betting odds.

The accusation follows an operation by German customs officials seized documents from the Caymen Island branch of Coutts as it arrrived in Hamburg port. The two containers inspected by German officials contained an estimated 14,000 documents. The officials moved in to discover details of suspected tax evasion by German nationals. Osama Bin Laden, pictured, was disowned by his wealthy family who made their fortune in construction . Coutts recently closed its branch in the Caribbean tax haven and was transferring the information to a special data centre in Geneva. According to the Daily Telegraph, European newspapers claimed that account details relating to Bin Laden and his family were among the documents seized in Hamburg. However Coutts denied they ever had a relationship with the terror leader. A spokesperson for the private bank said: 'We are not aware of any investigation into our trust company or its papers and we are working with the authorities to allow these papers to continue on their way. 'At no time have we ever looked after the financial affairs of Osama bin Laden or his immediate family. His individual financial affairs have never been an issue or interest of Coutts.' Bin Laden came from an incredibly wealthy family in Saudi Arabia that made its fortune in construction. His father, Mohammed, who died in 1967, had close links to the Saudi Royal Family. He had more than 50 children from 22 wives. However, it is understood that Osama Bin Laden had been disowned and cut off from any inheritance by the mid 1990s because of his links to terrorism. His eldest son Abdullah is understood to run an advertising agency in Saudi Arabia and has no links to extremism. A spokesperson for Coutts, pictured, said they have they 'ever looked after the financial affairs of Osama Bin Laden or his immediate family' Bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. He had at least five wives, but was only living with three of them when he killed by US Special Forces in Pakistan. It is understood that he had at least 20 children. Coutts has catered for the Royal Family since 1692 and in recent decades has encouraged 'new money'. The Beatles, Sting, and Sir Elton John are understood to have opened accounts there. But its closely guarded reputation has been tainted in more recent years. It was fined £8.75million in 2012 for ‘serious and systematic’ failings when handling money from suspected criminals or foreign despots. City regulators criticised the bank for taking ‘an unacceptable risk of handling the proceeds of crime’. Between 2007 and 2010 staff at the bank failed to check the source of funds when prospective clients tried to open accounts. As a result, money could have come from high-risk countries including Libya, Syria and Zimbabwe.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Coutts closed their Cayman Islands office and was shipping files to Geneva .\\nGerman officials raided two containers passing through Hamburg Port .\\nEuropean newspapers claimed Bin Laden was named in the documents .\\nCoutts denies any relationship with the terrorist or his immediate family .\\nCoutts has catered for the Royal family since 1682 .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\n(CNN) -- Authorities have officially dropped all charges against an American who tried to snatch back his children from his ex-wife in Japan, the Fukuoka prosecutor's office said Thursday. Charges had been technically \"on hold\" since Christopher Savoie was released from jail in October, though legal experts had said the move essentially meant the charges had already been dropped. The prosecutor's office said at the time that Savoie was released after he promised not to take his children back to the United States \"in this manner.\" It was not clear whether he had a chance to see his children after his release. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in January. The couple had lived in Japan, but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie received custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. On the day that the children were to start school in August, Savoie learned that his ex-wife had fled with them to Japan. Savoie later filed for and received full custody of the children, and police in Franklin, Tennessee, issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife. But Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague convention on international child abduction -- though the government has expressed interest in reconsidering -- so the warrant was not recognized by Tokyo. Japanese law follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, police said. The children also hold Japanese passports, Japanese authorities have said. Foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody, the U.S. State Department said. Savoie's current wife, Amy, said in October that her family has been ripped apart. \"Isaac and Rebecca had a very, very happy situation here in Tennessee,\" she said. \"They have people who love them here.\" She said she did not think the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children. \"There are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside.\" CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Christopher Savoie was jailed in Japan after trying to get kids back from mother .\\nNoriko Savoie was granted custody of kids, later fled to Japan .\\nChristopher Savoie was steps away from U.S. consulate when he was arrested .\\nAuthorities released Christopher Savoie after he said he would not take kids \\\"in this manner\\\"\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nAs the devious Thomas Cromwell, he cuts an imposing figure charting the treacherous waters of the Tudor court.

The sticker appeared to read ‘The F word is a dirty word’, an allusion to swearing, but smaller print after the F making clear the word was fracking. The process of drilling down into the ground to release natural gas has become a controversial topic among environmental campaigners. Rylance has never been one to hide his strong opinions on such issues. He was the main signatory of a letter to the Guardian in 2012 protesting at BP's sponsorship of the World Shakespeare Festival. Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in the hit BBC series Wolf Hall . It read: 'While the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill continues to devastate ecosystems and communities, and the highly polluting extraction of tar sands oil brings us rapidly closer to the point of no return from climate change, we feel that BP has no place in arts sponsorship.' He again set his sights on the oil company when it was announced as a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games, for which he was due to take part in the opening ceremony. Although he eventually pulled out because of the death of his stepdaughter, he admitted to almost pulling out over what he saw as morally dubious sponsorship deals. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I thought about it. The conversation about private sponsorship being supported by taxpayer' money, and private sponsorship from companies that are not really necessarily behaving all that ethically, big questions about BP, and big questions about McDonald's and the amount of sugar and obesity that's costing the NHS billions... 'I think those questions are good and I had thought since agreeing that maybe maybe I shouldn't be doing this, and if people feel critical of us who are taking part, I think they've got a point, a very good point.

Paul Hirst, Press Association . Defender Gary Cahill thinks England took an important step towards forgetting their Brazilian nightmare by winning in Switzerland. England started their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign in the best possible fashion on Monday night when they beat the Swiss 2-0. After such a miserable World Cup campaign, Cahill admits it felt good to get back to winning ways in the competitive arena. Good start: Gary Cahill, pictured tackling Admir Mehmedi, says England took a positive step forward by beating Switzerland 2-0 on Monday night . Crucial:  Cahill denied Switzerland's Josip Drmic a certain goal when England were just 1-0 up in Basle . Cahill accepts the pessimists will still take some convincing, but in beating their main Group E rivals, at least England have made a good start. 'We know about the disappointment in the summer but we draw a line under that now and move forward,' said the Chelsea defender, who was one of just two England players to take part in all three World Cup games. 'I don't think the criticism will be blown away. It is going to take time but it is a great start. 'In the period of two games we are not going to change everyone's opinion, but certainly I hope it is not all doom and gloom. Mobbed: England players celebrate with Danny Welbeck after he scored the second goal to wrap up a 2-0 win . 'I hope there are a few happy faces around. I think we deserve credit for this game and we are looking forward to next month.' Danny Welbeck scored an impressive double while Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney put on strong displays in attack. Cahill thinks praise should also be reserved for goalkeeper Joe Hart, who pulled off two stunning saves from Haris Seferovic. Cahill said: 'In the last two games, when called upon Joe has produced some important saves for us. He has been fantastic.'\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Gary Cahill thinks England took step in the right direction with win over Switzerland .\\nAfter disappointing World Cup, Three Lions beat Swiss 2-0 on Monday .\\nNew Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck scored twice in the victory .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nTunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Italy's coast guard says at least 1,623 migrants have landed on the tiny island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period. According to a coast guard statement released Tuesday, at least seven boats believed to have taken off from Tunisia landed on the Italian island with more than 400 passengers. The rest of the people were rescued at sea by Italian maritime patrols. Sailors at the Tunisian fishing port of Zarzis said they have seen a spike in the number of boats full of migrants departing on the dangerous 16- to 24-hour journey to Lampedusa, about 100 kilometers (62 miles, or 54 nautical miles) away. \"Yesterday, seven boats left here for Lampedusa,\" Faisal Jebnoun said Monday as he pulled seaweed and other debris from his net after a long day fishing for squid. \"The youth are crazy,\" Jebnoun added.  \"They all think they'll find a better life in Italy, and they don't even speak Italian!\" Italy has seen a surge in migrants from Tunisia since the North African country experienced a revolution in January that threw longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power. Lampedusa is often a favored target since it is one of the southernmost European points in the Mediterranean Sea. At one point, said Souei Abdesslem, president of the Blue-fish Union in Zarzis, so many young Tunisians were anxious to smuggle themselves to Europe that fishermen began sleeping in their boats to prevent them from being stolen for the hazardous passage across the Mediterranean. The Italian coast guard reported that it had rescued five passengers Sunday night who said their boat sank, with 35 other passengers still missing. Dozens of passengers from a Tunisian boat are believed to have died in January after it collided with a Tunisian coast guard vessel on a similar journey. Coast guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro said he expects that the recent surge of migrants will decrease because of forecasts of stormy weather in the days ahead.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"At least 1,623 landed on the island over a 24-hour period .\\nFishing port of Zarzis is about 100 kilometers from island of Lampedusa .\\nItaly has seen a surge of migrants since revolution overthrew Tunisian president .\\nNumbers expected to decrease amid forecasts of stormy weather .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nA truck driver's dash-cam has captured the heart-stopping moment a car travelling next to him slammed into the front of his vehicle after spinning 180 degrees onto oncoming traffic.

In the complaint, the employees said the airline refused to empty the plane of its more than 300 passengers and perform a security inspection. The employees, all with 18 or more years of experience, refused to work believing the lives of the passengers and crew were in danger, Reuters reports. The flight was delayed and soon cancelled. The employees were fired for insubordination, according to the complaint. The workers said in the complaint that they had been on alert following an incident one week earlier where federal authorities announced an enhanced security screening due to the threat of explosive devices onboard. Warning: The former-employees said they were seeking additional security measure following a possible phone-and-laptop bomb warning a week earlier from the Transportation Security Administration . The former-employees said they were seeking additional security measure following a possible phone-and-laptop bomb warning a week earlier from the Transportation Security Administration.

At a community meeting with well owners, EPA officials revealed Tuesday they found low levels of petroleum compounds in 17 of 19 drinking water wells sampled, and that nearby shallow groundwater was contaminated with high levels of petroleum compounds such as benzene, according to the report. The affected well owners were advised not to drink the water at the recommendation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and told to use alternate sources of water for drinking and cooking, agency officials said. Meanwhile, the EPA is working with various government partners and EnCana, a natural gas company, to provide affected residents with water and to address potential sources of the contamination, agency officials said. The study included sampling 21 domestic wells within the area of concern, two municipal wells, plus sediment and water from a nearby creek. The EPA also sampled groundwater and soil from pit remediation sites, and produced water and condensate from five production wells operated by the primary natural gas operator in the area, agency officials said. No health concerns were found related to inhalation exposure to chemicals while showering or using evaporative coolers, agency officials said. The EPA has not reached any conclusions about the sources of chemical compounds found in drinking water wells, including hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground, agency officials said. Officials are uncertain if the contaminated shallow groundwater will migrate to the drinking water aquifer, according to the report. \"EPA will work as long as necessary to ensure that Pavillion residents have safe water,\" Jim Martin, EPA's regional administrator in Denver, said in a statement released Tuesday. \"While our investigation continues, EPA has secured commitments from our partners to identify alternate sources of water for affected homes and to evaluate long-term solutions.\" In addition to detecting several petroleum hydrocarbons, the EPA found a number of \"inorganic constituents\" such as sodium and sulfates in drinking and groundwater wells, according to the report. In spring 2008, residents of Pavillion -- concerned about the quality of their drinking water -- contacted the EPA in Denver, Colorado.

Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 08:01 EST, 29 February 2012 . Scientists have found evidence of flu in bats for the first time - and warn it could pose a threat to humans. U.S. health officials say they found genetic fragments of a never-before-seen virus in some Guatemalan bats. Flu bugs are common in humans, birds, pigs and a variety of other mammals, but this is the first time one has been documented in these winged mammals. Carrier: The influenza virus has recently been detected in the yellow-shouldered bat in Guatemala . 'Most people were fairly convinced we had . already discovered flu in all the possible' animals, said Ruben Donis, a . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist who co-authored . the new study. Scientists suspect that some bats caught . flu centuries ago and that the virus mutated within the bat population . into this new variety. Scientists haven't been able to grow the new . virus in chicken eggs or in human cell culture, as they do with more . conventional flu strains and it is not clear if, or how well, it spreads. However, it still could pose a threat to . humans. If it mingled with more common forms of influenza, . it could swap genes and mutate into something more dangerous, a scenario . at the heart of the global flu epidemic movie 'Contagion.' The research was posted online Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The CDC has an international outpost in Guatemala where researchers collected more than 300 bats in 2009 and 2010. The research was mainly focused on rabies, but the scientists also checked specimens for other germs and stumbled upon the new virus. It was in the intestines of little yellow-shouldered bats. These bats eat fruit and insects but don't bite people. Yet it's possible they could leave the virus on produce and a human could get infected by taking a bite. A health worker in Vietnam sprays disinfectant at the site of a suspected outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus among ducks. The virus has killed 345 people since 2003. A bat flu strain could theoretically also spread to humans . 'It's conceivable some people were infected with the virus in the past. Now that scientists know what it looks like, they are looking for it in other bats as well as humans and other animals', said Mr Donis. However, Richard Fulton, a bird disease researcher at Michigan State University, said more evidence was needed. He said all they had found was a segment of genetic material and not a fully-fledged virus. Mr Donis said work is going on to try to infect healthy bats, but noted there are other viruses that were discovered by genetic sequencing but are hard to grow in a lab, including hepatitis C.\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"U.S health officials have found influenza in Guatemalan bats .\\nStrain could pose a risk to humans if it mingled with more common forms of flu .\\nScientists haven't yet been able to grow the new .\\nvirus in chicken eggs or in human cells in a lab .\"}\n```", "history": ""}, {"system": "You are a professional NLP data parser.\nFollow the provided `Task` by the user\nand the `Output Scheme` to generate the `Output JSON`.\nDo not generate any introduction or conclusion.", "instruction": "# Text:\nBy .

The 36-year-old midfielder, who was serenaded by the visiting fans at the Etihad Stadium, struck five minutes from time after being picked out by James Milner to cancel out Andre Schurrle's 71st-minute opener. Lampard told Sky Sports: 'It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I didn't come on and do my job, so I was trying to get into the box and it was a great ball back from Milly. Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . The City midfielder looked close to tears after scoring a crucial goal against his former club . 'It's a tough one for me. I had 13 amazing years with the Chelsea fans, so I am mixed with it. I am obviously pleased the team I play for got a draw. 'I am a little lost for words. I didn't expect to come on and score like that. I came on and the Chelsea fans were singing, and that's emotional. Then I am playing for this club, who have taken me in brilliantly as well, so I am really stuck in the middle here.' Delighted City boss Manuel Pellegrini insisted he had no qualms about using Lampard after speaking to him before the game, during which City defender Pablo Zabaleta was dismissed for a second bookable offence. Lampard cannot bring himself to celebrate the all-important goal, his first for his new side, against Chelsea . Chelsea's travelling fans, though disappointed by the defeat, stayed behind to applaud their hero . He said: 'I asked him if he wanted to be involved, and of course he wanted to be involved. That shows how great a professional Lampard is. 'I am sure he was not happy to score against such an important team in his career, but he's a good professional, he is a very good player.' Opposite number Jose Mourinho, for whom Lampard was such a key figure during his first spell at Stamford Bridge, was pragmatic about the former England midfielder's contribution. Mourinho said: 'He is a Man City player. I don't believe in these histories of passion and heart, I don't believe in these. Maybe I am too pragmatic in football. 'When he decided to come to Man City, a direct competitor of Chelsea, love stories are over. He did his job as the super professional he is, and he did well.' Despite scoring against them, Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, remains a legend to their fans . Lampard's former teammates Branislav Ivanovic and Andre Schurrle have seen him score all too often . The former England star looked apologetic as he refused to celebrate, and then applauded both sets of fans .\n# Task:\nsummarized the given text and save the response as JSON\n# Output Scheme:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Request model for text summarization.\\nAttributes:\\n    summarized_text (str): The text to be summarized.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"summarized_text\": {\n      \"description\": \"summarized text.\",\n      \"maxLength\": 300,\n      \"minLength\": 10,\n      \"title\": \"Summarized Text\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"summarized_text\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"TextSummarization\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}\nOutput JSON:\n```json", "input": "", "output": "```json\n{\"summarized_text\": \"Frank Lampard comes off the bench to equalise for Manchester City .\\nLampard is Chelsea's all-time record goalscorer .\\nFormer England midfielder applauded from the field by both sets of fans and spends time waving to travelling supporters .\\nLampard says 'I didn't expect to come on and scored today'\"}\n```", "history": ""}]
