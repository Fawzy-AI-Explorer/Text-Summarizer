        " The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Constructed for the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by many prominent artists and intellectuals of the time for its design. However, over the years, the tower has become a global cultural icon and a symbol of French engineering prowess. Standing at 324 meters, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. Today, it attracts millions of tourists annually and remains a testament to Gustave Eiffel's visionary engineering."
