        "Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other elements of the Earth's climate system. It is primarily driven by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, resulting from human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and threats to biodiversity. Addressing this global challenge requires coordinated international efforts to reduce emissions, adapt to new environmental conditions, and transition to sustainable sources of energy."
